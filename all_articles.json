        "introduction": "Opportunities to perform biological studies in space are rare due to high costs and a limited number of funding sources, rocket launches, and spaceflight crew hours for experimental procedures. In addition, spaceflight research is decentralized and distributed across numerous laboratories in the United States and abroad. As a result, studies performed in different laboratories often utilize different organisms, strains, cell lines, and experimental procedures. Adding to this complexity are variance in spaceflight factors and/or confounders within each study, such as degree of radiation exposure, experiment duration, CO2 concentration, light cycle, and water availability, all of which can have effects on an organism's health and gene expression profiles during spaceflight (Rutter et al., 2020). In order to optimize the integration of data from this diverse array of spaceflight experiments, it is paramount that variations in data processing are minimized.",
        "methods": "All methods can be found in the accompanying transparent methods supplemental file.",
        "results": "There are three distinct steps to the RCP, the first of which is data preprocessing (Figure 2A). The pipeline begins with quality control (QC) of raw FASTQ files from a short-read Illumina sequencer using the FastQC software (Andrews, 2010) (Figure 2B). FastQC is one of the most widely used QC programs for short-read sequencing data. It provides information that can be used to assess sample and sequencing quality, including base statistics, per base sequencing quality, per sequence quality scores, per base sequence content, per base GC content, per sequence GC content, per base N content, sequence length distributions, sequence duplication levels, overrepresented sequences, and k-mer content.",
        "discussion": "The differentially expressed genes calculated by the RCP can be further explored with a variety of tools designed for higher-order analysis. For example, there are tools that can look for enriched pathways, gene ontology terms, or protein and/or metabolite networks. Popular software tools among the GeneLab working group members include WebGestalt (Liao et al., 2019), STRING (Szklarczyk et al., 2019), GSEA (Subramanian et al., 2005), PIANO (Väremo et al. 2013), Reactome (Szklarczyk et al., 2019), and ToppFun (Chen et al., 2009). There is no universal consensus on which tools are the most useful for higher-order analysis (Nguyen et al., 2019). RCP users are encouraged to try multiple tools in order to analyze their data from a variety of perspectives."

        "introduction": "Humanity is on the brink of a new era in space exploration, with NASA and international partners committed to returning to the Moon and planned manned missions to Mars (Dawson, 2016). Exposure to space radiation and microgravity are primary hazards to astronauts’ health in long-duration space missions (Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019). In addition to the known increased cancer risk from chronic low doses of radiation exposure (Durante and Cucinotta, 2008), astronauts that returned from missions on the International Space Station (ISS) presented with health issues similar to geriatric stress, including bone and muscle mass loss, central nervous system issues, immune dysfunction, and cardiovascular health risks (Strollo et al., 2018). Future success in long-duration space exploration requires a comprehensive understanding of the impact of spaceflight on human biology, and such knowledge could be used to design efficient countermeasures that would benefit astronauts and the health of people on Earth.",
        "methods": "",
        "results": "Global analysis of the mRNA, protein, and metabolite responses to spaceflight across all GeneLab data (Fig. 1A–1D and Table S1) was performed by calculating the average number of differentially detected molecules between in-flight (FLT) and ground control (GC) samples. We found that cultured human cells and primary human hair follicles had the strongest response to spaceflight than other cells and tissues (vs genes regulated with adj. p<0.05). From the ten mouse tissues included in the analysis, we found that the soleus muscle, extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle, and liver had the highest number of differentially expressed genes (Table S1).",
        "discussion": "Utilizing an integrated, comprehensive, and multi-omics systems biology approach, we have uncovered insights into fundamental biological mechanisms affected by spaceflight. Our analyses suggest systemic shifts in mitochondrial function occur in spaceflight in most of the tissues we examined. Mitochondrial changes likely impact processes such as innate immunity, lipid metabolism, and gene regulation in both mice and humans, and the results from our analyses are consistent with those from previous studies (Beheshti et al., 2019; Suomalainen and Battersby, 2018) and are supported by multiple other omics studies (Bezdan et al., 2020; Gertz et al., 2020). Raising awareness for adverse health outcomes during spaceflight will help guide scientific community responses to mitigate spaceflight associated health risks and develop appropriate countermeasures."

        "introduction": "Opportunities to perform biological studies in space are rare due to high costs and a limited number of funding sources, rocket launches, and spaceflight crew hours for experimental procedures. In addition, spaceflight research is decentralized and distributed across numerous laboratories in the United States and abroad. As a result, studies performed in different laboratories often utilize different organisms, strains, cell lines, and experimental procedures. Adding to this complexity are variance in spaceflight factors and/or confounders within each study, such as degree of radiation exposure, experiment duration, CO2 concentration, light cycle, and water availability, all of which can have effects on an organism's health and gene expression profiles during spaceflight (Rutter et al., 2020). In order to optimize the integration of data from this diverse array of spaceflight experiments, it is paramount that variations in data processing are minimized.",
        "methods": "All methods can be found in the accompanying transparent methods supplemental file.",
        "results": "There are three distinct steps to the RCP, the first of which is data preprocessing (Figure 2A). The pipeline begins with quality control (QC) of raw FASTQ files from a short-read Illumina sequencer using the FastQC software (Andrews, 2010) (Figure 2B). FastQC is one of the most widely used QC programs for short-read sequencing data. It provides information that can be used to assess sample and sequencing quality, including base statistics, per base sequencing quality, per sequence quality scores, per base sequence content, per base GC content, per sequence GC content, per base N content, sequence length distributions, sequence duplication levels, overrepresented sequences, and k-mer content.",
        "discussion": "The differentially expressed genes calculated by the RCP can be further explored with a variety of tools designed for higher-order analysis. For example, there are tools that can look for enriched pathways, gene ontology terms, or protein and/or metabolite networks. Popular software tools among the GeneLab working group members include WebGestalt (Liao et al., 2019), STRING (Szklarczyk et al., 2019), GSEA (Subramanian et al., 2005), PIANO (Väremo et al. 2013), Reactome (Szklarczyk et al., 2019), and ToppFun (Chen et al., 2009). There is no universal consensus on which tools are the most useful for higher-order analysis (Nguyen et al., 2019). RCP users are encouraged to try multiple tools in order to analyze their data from a variety of perspectives."

Mutations in and loss of DGC proteins cause a spectrum of muscular dystrophies. When only the sarcoglycan subcomplex is absent, muscles display severe myofiber degeneration, but little susceptibility to contractile damage, suggesting that disease occurs not by structural deficits but through aberrant signaling, namely, loss of normal mechanotransduction signaling through the sarcoglycan complex.",

Mutations in DGC components cause different types of muscular dystrophy; for example, mutations in dystrophin cause Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), while mutations in α-, β-, γ-, or δ-sarcoglycan (SG) cause limb girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) [2-4].",

      "abstract": "Fluid and macromolecule transport from the interstitium into and through lymphatic vessels is necessary for tissue homeostasis. While lymphatic capillary structure suggests that passive, paracellular transport would be the predominate route of macromolecule entry, active caveolae-mediated transcellular transport has been identified in lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) in vitro. Caveolae also mediate a wide array of endothelial cell processes, including nitric oxide regulation. Thus, how does the lack of caveolae impact “lymphatic function”?",
      "sections": {
        "introduction": "Lymphatic vessels complete the circulatory loop by transporting away fluid, macromolecules, and immune cells that have extravasated into the interstitium from blood vessels. As such, lymphatic vessels maintain tissue homeostasis by regulating fluid balance and modulating immunity1. Lymph uptake and propulsion is increasingly appreciated as critical in health and disease2. The structure of lymphatic vessels is well-suited for these roles. Initial lymphatic capillaries have overlapping button-like junctions that permit passive entry of fluid and large molecules3. Downstream collecting lymphatic vessels have tight, zipper-like junctions, unidirectional valves, and are covered with lymphatic muscle cells that demonstrate intrinsic contractility: all to help transport lymph from the periphery4. Lymph transport is further aided by extrinsic movements to move lymph through collecting vessels. From the initial uptake of fluid through its downstream transport, there are many potential regulators of lymphatic transport function.",
        "methods": "CavKO mice: Cav-1 null mice on an FVB background were acquired from the laboratory of Philipp Scherer at UT Southwestern Medical Center who maintained mice originally acquired from the Lisanti group36. Mice were maintained by intermittently breeding to wildtype FVB/NJ mice (The Jackson Laboratory, stock: 001800) and breeding and reselecting for knockout mice. Systemic deletion of Cav-1 was identified by PCR and confirmed by western blotting with WT cousins used as controls. LyCav mice: Lyve1-Cre mice were acquired from The Jackson Laboratory (stock: 012601) and backcrossed to wildtype FVB/NJ mice for over 6 generation before crossing to FVB Cav1flox/flox mice37. LyCav mice were continually backcrossed and maintained on an FVB/NJ background. Due to Lyve-Cre mice demonstrating germline activity from males, male Lyve1-Cre−/− Cav1flox/flox mice were crossed with female Lyve1-Cre+/− Cav1flox/flox mice to generate experimental cohorts. Systemic lack of recombination of the loxP-flanked caveolin exon was verified by PCR in all Cav1flox/flox mice used for breeding and experiments (Supp Fig 1). All mice were maintained in AAALAC approved facilities with ad libitum access to food and water. Male and female mice, aged 16-20 weeks, were used in equal proportions for all experiments as indicated. All animal protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Texas A&M University (College Station, TX).",
        "results": "When CavKO were first generated one of the first phenotypes characterized was a change in blood vascular endothelial cell density in some tissues and increased vessel permeability in others10,14. Despite blood vessel leakiness being previously reported to be elevated in several tissues as judged by infused Evan’s blue dye extravasation10, following the same protocol, we measured a significant increase in Evan’s blue levels only in the dermis of CavKO mice (Fig. 1a). We thus focused our examination on the skin. Changes in blood vessel permeability alter interstitial fluid dynamics and indeed, we measured a significant increase in tissue hydration in the dermis of CavKO mice (Fig. 1b). The total collagen content of the dermis was also significantly increased (Fig. 1c). Micropuncture was used to measure the hydrostatic interstitial fluid pressure and it was significantly elevated in the tail skin of CavKO mice (Fig. 1d). Elevated dermal blood capillary permeability thus results in increased skin tissue water and interstitial fluid pressure.",
        "discussion": "Here we demonstrate that caveolae are involved in multiple process that control various aspects of lymphatic function. CavKO mice demonstrated increased albumin extravasation, tissue hydration, collagen content, and interstitial fluid pressure in the dermis. The lymphatic capillaries in these mice appear normal in the dermis, but interstitial fluid and macromolecule clearance is increased. Similarly, CavKO LECs demonstrate increased permeability. Intrinsic lymph propulsion through collecting lymphatic vessels in CavKO mice, however, is nearly absent. These phenomena are similar in mice with LEC-specific Cav1 deletion."

      "abstract": "Human occupied built environments are no longer confined to Earth. In fact, there have been humans living and working in low-Earth orbit on the International Space Station (ISS) since November 2000. With NASA’s Artemis missions and the age of commercial space stations set to begin, more human-occupied spacecraft than ever will be in Earth’s orbit and beyond. On Earth and in the ISS, microbes, especially fungi, can be found in dust and grow when unexpected, elevated moisture conditions occur. However, we do not yet know how indoor microbiomes in Earth-based homes and in the ISS differ due to their unique set of environmental conditions. Here we show that bacterial and fungal communities are different in dust collected from vacuum bags on Earth and the ISS, with Earth-based homes being more diverse (465 fungal OTUs and 237 bacterial ASVs) compared to the ISS (102 fungal OTUs and 102 bacterial ASVs). When dust from these locations were exposed to varying equilibrium relative humidity conditions (ERH), there were also significant fungal community composition changes as ERH and time elevated increased (Bray Curtis: R2 = 0.35, P = 0.001). These findings can inform future spacecraft design to promote healthy indoor microbiomes that support crew health, spacecraft integrity, and planetary protection.",

        "introduction": "In the upcoming decades, human activity in space will rapidly expand both in low-Earth orbit (LEO) and beyond to an estimated $1.4 trillion dollar industry1. NASA’s Artemis missions, which will send humans back to the moon, includes a lunar orbiting space station (The Lunar Gateway) as well as a lunar surface habitat, and will all be a stepping stone to sending humans to Mars2. In addition, private companies, such as Starlab Space, LLC and Blue Origin, are building commercially owned and operated space stations with support from NASA’s commercial LEO destination initiative3. The rapid increase in the number of people living and working in space will require careful spacecraft design to support human health and wellbeing. One critical aspect of this design is to understand the microorganisms within a spacecraft.",
        "methods": "This study aims to understand the differences between the indoor microbiomes of Earth-based residential buildings and dust collected from the International Space Station (ISS). Specifically, ISS dust and residential carpet with dust previously collected from homes in Ohio were incubated under varying relative humidity conditions using the time-of-wetness framework19,20. Fungal and bacterial DNA was extracted from these incubated samples, sequenced with Illumina MiSeq, and analyzed with a bioinformatics pipeline to determine taxonomy.",

These samples are referred to as “original dust” and are the dust collected from vacuum bags from both locations that were not exposed to any elevated equilibrium relative humidity (ERH) conditions in the laboratory prior to analysis. In total we had 15 original dust samples from Earth (1 sample each from 15 separate homes) and 4 original dust samples from the ISS (which included 3 triplicates from a total of four separate ISS vacuum bags). The most abundant fungal genera from these locations were different. Epicoccum, Alternaria, Pseudopithomyces, and Cladosporium were the dominant fungal genera on Earth while Aspergillus, Cyberlindnera, Rhodotorula, and Candida were more abundant on the ISS (Fig. 1a).",
        "discussion": "There are clear differences in bacterial and fungal communities in dust collected from Earth-based residential homes and from the ISS. This includes original dust immediately removed from a vacuum bag as well as after this dust is exposed to varying elevated moisture conditions to encourage rapid microbial growth. In general, these difference were more pronounced in fungi, especially under elevated moisture conditions, presumably because fungi are more sensitive to changing moisture conditions when compared to bacteria10,11,20. Interestingly, fungal communities in ISS dust changed much more rapidly compared to Earth house dust with varying moisture conditions mainly due to Aspergillus dominating in the ISS dust. These differences may be attributed to the unique stressors faced by microbes during spaceflight conditions such as microgravity21, low-dose radiation22, and elevated CO2 concentrations23 which allows them to rapidly grow when ideal conditions are introduced."

Previous research has shown declines in femoral bone and marrow perfusion during unloading and with subsequent reloading in hindlimb-unloaded (HU) rats, an animal model of chronic disuse. We hypothesized that the attenuated bone and marrow perfusion may result from altered vasomotor properties of the bone resistance vasculature. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the effects of unloading on the vasoconstrictor and vasodilator properties of the femoral principal nutrient artery (PNA), the main conduit for blood flow to the femur, in 2 wk HU and control (CON) rats.",

      "abstract": "The Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor SYP41 is involved in vesicle fusion at the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and interacts with AtVPS45, SYP61, and VTI12. These proteins are involved in diverse cellular processes, including vacuole biogenesis and stress tolerance. A previously uncharacterized protein, named TNO1 (for TGN-localized SYP41-interacting protein), was identified by coimmunoprecipitation as a SYP41-interacting protein. TNO1 was found to localize to the TGN by immunofluorescence microscopy. A tno1 mutant showed increased sensitivity to high concentrations of NaCl, KCl, and LiCl and also to mannitol-induced osmotic stress. Localization of SYP61, which is involved in the salt stress response, was disrupted in the tno1 mutant. Vacuolar proteins were partially secreted to the apoplast in the tno1 mutant, suggesting that TNO1 is required for efficient protein trafficking to the vacuole. The tno1 mutant had delayed formation of the brefeldin A (BFA) compartment in cotyledons upon application of BFA, suggesting less efficient membrane fusion processes in the mutant. Unlike most TGN proteins, TNO1 does not relocate to the BFA compartment upon BFA treatment. These data demonstrate that TNO1 is involved in vacuolar trafficking and salt tolerance, potentially via roles in vesicle fusion and in maintaining TGN structure or identity.",

        "results": "SYP41 is a t-SNARE at the TGN that is required for vesicle fusion in Arabidopsis and forms a complex with VTI12, SYP61, and AtVPS45 (Bassham and Raikhel, 2000; Chen et al., 2005). To identify additional SYP41-interacting proteins, detergent-solubilized membrane extracts of Arabidopsis suspension cells were immunoprecipitated using SYP41 antibody. Proteins that coimmunoprecipitated with SYP41, or with preimmune antibody as a control, were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver staining. Four bands corresponding to proteins migrating at approximately 200, 67, 35, and 15 kD were found only in the SYP41 precipitate and were not present in the SYP41 preimmune precipitate, suggesting that they specifically interacted with SYP41 (Fig. 1A).",
        "discussion": "TNO1 was identified as a novel protein that coimmunoprecipitates with SYP41. As SYP41 is a t-SNARE residing at the TGN, we hypothesize that TNO1 may also be involved in vesicle fusion at this organelle. We have demonstrated that TNO1 is involved in salt and osmotic stress responses and is required for efficient vacuolar trafficking. Based on the effects of BFA treatment, TNO1 is proposed to be involved in the formation of the BFA compartment and may function in maintaining TGN structure or identity.",
        "materials and methods": "Protein extracts were made essentially as described by Bassham et al. (2000) and Sanderfoot et al. (2001a). Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) suspension cells were ground in extraction buffer (phosphate-buffered saline [PBS], 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% [v/v] Triton X-100) and solubilized for 2 h at 4°C. Solubilized proteins were added to a column containing immobilized SYP41 antibodies or SYP41 preimmune serum and incubated for 2 h at 4°C. The columns were washed five times with extraction buffer, and bound proteins were eluted using 0.2 m Gly, pH 2.5. Immunoprecipitates from SYP41 and preimmune antibody were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized using silver staining.",

        "methods": "For the present study, we used human induced pluripotent (hiPS)-derived OLPs. Four years prior to the space flight, we established a culture system with a homogeneous population of NSCs that was obtained from the original hiPS cell line “CS83iCTR-33-n1” (fibroblasts), “reprogrammed” and provided to us by Cedars-Sinai Medical Center via a material transfer agreement.",
        "results": "Secretomes of the OLPs kept for 26 days in 1G (1G OLP 26D) or SPC (SPC OLP 26D) were compared to the reference medium (OSM alone), using five biological replicates (see Section 2). Their mass spectra were globally examined, then compared one by one for the intensity of their components’ signals, to evidence a specific profile for each of these groups.",
        "discussion": "We all were born, developed and have lived in Earth’s gravity and, for technical reasons, the effect of gravity has been, so far, poorly explored, although its mechanical effects are germane to the well-documented effect of cell contacts during their growth, development and differentiation."

The T-DNA positions are in the 3′ UTR (untranslated region) of DREB2A (Dehydration-responsive element-binding protein 2A) (AT5G05410) and promoter of LOX1 (Lipoxygenase 1) (AT1G55020) as determined by DNA-PCR and sanger sequencing. The expression levels of DREB2A and LOX1 were also analyzed using quantitative realtime PCR (qPCR) in SALK_084889 and wild type Arabidopsis (Col, Columbia). Further, the comparison of drought and heat tolerance between Col and SALK_084889 were conducted by stress treatments. The present data indicate that in SALK_084889, the expression of DREB2A is not downregulated under normal growth conditions but can be affected only in roots under drought treatment, while LOX1 is significantly downregulated in both roots and shoots under all tested conditions. These data are original and have not been published elsewhere.",

Directional growth of roots occurs by a combination of sensing external cues, hormonal signaling and cytoskeletal changes in the root cells.

Root development and architecture are well-studied [1] but our understanding of how roots interact with soil components is still incomplete. This is due in part to the difficulty of visualizing roots as they move into the soil, although recent developments such as the GLO-Roots platform aid in imaging this process [2, 3]. Root growth into the substratum presents multiple cues to the root tip such as mechanical obstacles, moisture and nutrient gradients. These cues are integrated and then signal downstream processes involving hormonal pathways and cell expansion [4]. This leads to a cumulative physiological response driving root movement and establishing the root architecture.",
        "methods": "Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 (wild-type, WT) and tno1 knockout mutant (SALK_112503) were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center; the complemented tno1 mutant was generated previously in our laboratory [35]. Arabidopsis seeds were surface-sterilized in 33% bleach, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 20 min, rinsed 5 times with sterile water and kept in the dark at 4 °C for at least 2 days before being subjected to the root skewing and waving assays or drug sensitivity assays described below.",
        "results": "Mutants lacking TNO1 have normal root elongation, but show a lag in root gravitropic bending upon gravistimulation [36]. Positive gravitropism is a key component driving root waving and skewing, and hence we hypothesized that TNO1 might play a role in these processes.",
        "discussion": "TNO1 plays important roles in post-Golgi trafficking, gravitropism and auxin transport-dependent processes. Here we demonstrate that TNO1 is required for root skewing and CFR formation. Skewing of tno1 mutant roots increased to a greater extent upon MT stabilization by taxol when compared to WT roots but was resistant to MT destabilization by PPD."

The media was solidified with 0.5% (w/v) Phytagel (Sigma‐Aldrich).

      "abstract": "The trans-Golgi network (TGN) is a dynamic organelle that functions as a relay station for receiving endocytosed cargo, directing secretory cargo, and trafficking to the vacuole. TGN-localized SYP41-interacting protein (TNO1) is a large, TGN-localized, coiled-coil protein that associates with the membrane fusion protein SYP41, a target SNARE, and is required for efficient protein trafficking to the vacuole.",
      "sections": {
        "introduction": "The trans-Golgi network (TGN) is a highly dynamic tubulo-vesicular organelle that matures from the two or three trans-most cisternae of the Golgi (Staehelin and Kang, 2008) and is crucial for endocytic, secretory and vacuolar trafficking routes in plant cells.",
        "methods": "Arabidopsis seeds were surface-sterilized in 33% bleach, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 20 min, rinsed five times with sterile water and kept in the dark at 4°C for at least 2 days.",
        "results": "Auxin signaling pathways are integral to LR development during root architecture establishment (Lavenus et al., 2013). Polar auxin transport mediates emergence of LRs from the primary axis, and several auxin transport mutants display slow rates of emergence (Hobbie and Estelle, 1995; Ruegger et al., 1997).",
        "discussion": "Auxin flow in plants is an important determinant of root architecture and tropic bending such as gravitropism. The polar transport of auxin depends on the specific localization of auxin transporters, which in turn is dependent on the cellular trafficking machinery."

This study evaluates the mechanism for increased virulence of the opportunistic gram-negative bacterium, Serratia marcescens, in simulated microgravity.

Factors stimulating ATP release include wounding, osmotic stress and elicitors. Here we show that exogenous abscisic acid and L-glutamate can also cause ATP accumulation around Arabidopsis thaliana roots. Release of ADP from root epidermis would trigger ionotropic receptor-like activity in the plasma membrane, resulting in transient elevation of cytosolic free calcium. Root epidermal protoplasts (expressing aequorin as a cytosolic free calcium reporter) can support an extracellular ADP-induced cytosolic calcium elevation in the presence of an extracellular reductant. This confirms that ADP could elicit calcium-based responses distinct to those of ATP, which have been shown previously to involve production of extracellular reactive oxygen species.",

Directional growth of roots occurs by a combination of sensing external cues, hormonal signaling and cytoskeletal changes in the root cells. Roots growing on slanted, impenetrable growth medium display a characteristic waving and skewing, and mutants with deviations in these phenotypes assist in identifying genes required for root movement. Our study identifies a role for a trans-Golgi network-localized protein in root skewing.",
      "sections": {
        "introduction": "Establishment of the root system of a plant is crucial for efficient anchorage and nutrient acquisition. Root development and architecture are well-studied [1] but our understanding of how roots interact with soil components is still incomplete. This is due in part to the difficulty of visualizing roots as they move into the soil, although recent developments such as the GLO-Roots platform aid in imaging this process [2, 3]. Root growth into the substratum presents multiple cues to the root tip such as mechanical obstacles, moisture and nutrient gradients. These cues are integrated and then signal downstream processes involving hormonal pathways and cell expansion [4]. This leads to a cumulative physiological response driving root movement and establishing the root architecture.",

Arabidopsis seeds were surface-sterilized in 33% bleach, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 20 min, rinsed 5 times with sterile water and kept in the dark at 4 °C for at least 2 days before being subjected to the root skewing and waving assays or drug sensitivity assays described below.",
        "results": "Mutants lacking TNO1 have normal root elongation, but show a lag in root gravitropic bending upon gravistimulation [36]. Positive gravitropism is a key component driving root waving and skewing, and hence we hypothesized that TNO1 might play a role in these processes.",
        "discussion": "TNO1 plays important roles in post-Golgi trafficking, gravitropism and auxin transport-dependent processes. Here we demonstrate that TNO1 is required for root skewing and CFR formation. Skewing of tno1 mutant roots increased to a greater extent upon MT stabilization by taxol when compared to WT roots but was resistant to MT destabilization by PPD."

        "introduction": "The terrestrial colonization of plants is a critical milestone in the Earth’s evolution history, dramatically increasing the productivity of organic carbon on land to support highly diverse ecosystems1,2. The emergence of roots with a gravitropic growth pattern is a critical evolution for land plants, enabling them to anchor in the soil and absorb water and nutrients3. Root gravitropism features perception of gravity by the root cap and directional growth regulation mediated by auxin4. In gravity-oriented roots, symmetrical distribution of auxin in root tips maintain symmetrical growth5. When root growth deviates from the direction of gravity, the amyloplasts in the columella cells of the root cap rapidly sink to the plasma membrane at the bottom, triggering the activation of gravity response via LAZY proteins6,7. Such response entails relocation of the auxin exporter PIN-FORMED (PIN) in the cells and redistribution of auxin8–10, thus promoting asymmetric auxin flow and asymmetric cell growth to bend the root tip to the gravity direction11. Mutations in auxin transporters and gravity-signaling-related proteins often lead to defective root gravitropism during vertical growth, such as root tips growing toward random directions7,12,13, wavy roots14, and enlarged root angles15,16.",
        "methods": "The japonica rice cultivar Zhonghua11 was used as the wild type (WT) for all experiments. An ethyl methylsulfonate (EMS)-mutagenized population (M3 generation) was used for root phenotype screening. Transgenic plant materials were generated as described below. Seeds were surface sterilized with 15% NaClO for 30 min, washed with sterilized water, and placed in a 37 °C incubator for 2 days to promote germination. Germinated seeds were transferred to hydroponic boxes, soil culture boxes or agar plates to grow depending on the requirements of different experiments. Experiments were carried out in a growth room with the following conditions: temperature 28 °C ± 0.5 °C, humidity 50%–60%, 12-h photoperiod with a light intensity of 100 mmol of photons m−2 s−1. WT and mutant were also grown in two paddy fields (Nanjing and Sanya) to maturity.",
        "results": "We screened an ethyl methylsulfonate-mutagenized population (approximately 5000 lines) of the rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivar Zhonghua11 and isolated a mutant with root coiling phenotype when grown in hydroponic culture (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Movie 1). Both seminal and adventitious roots of the mutant coiled in the root tip region, resulting in a shorter root depth compared to the wild type (WT, Supplementary Fig. 1). Changes in nutrient supply, solution pH, aeration (dissolved oxygen level), and exposure to light did not alter the root coiling phenotype of the mutant in hydroponic culture (Supplementary Fig. 2). When grown in water-saturated solid media (e.g. paddy soil, soil-vermiculite mixture, vermiculite and peat pellet), however, the root coiling phenotype disappeared (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 3). We named the mutant coiling root in water (crw1).",
        "discussion": "Ethylene plays a critical role in plant growth, development and resistance to multiple biotic and abiotic stresses. Because ethylene biosynthesis fluctuates widely under the influence of changing environments18,51, its effect on gravitropic growth of roots must be tightly regulated. In this study, by dissecting the genetic basis for the root coiling phenotype in the rice mutant crw1, we uncovered the molecular module of OsCRW1 (OsEBF1)-OsEIL1/OsEIL2-OsERF82-ROS that connects ethylene signaling to gravitropism in rice roots (Fig. 8). Furthermore, by addressing why growing in soft solid media rescued root coiling phenotype of crw1, we discovered an unexpected role of root cap mechanosensing in limiting excessive ethylene signaling, thereby safeguarding gravitropic growth of rice roots (Fig. 8)."

      "sections": {
        "introduction": "The terrestrial colonization of plants is a critical milestone in the Earth’s evolution history, dramatically increasing the productivity of organic carbon on land to support highly diverse ecosystems1,2. The emergence of roots with a gravitropic growth pattern is a critical evolution for land plants, enabling them to anchor in the soil and absorb water and nutrients3. Root gravitropism features perception of gravity by the root cap and directional growth regulation mediated by auxin4. In gravity-oriented roots, symmetrical distribution of auxin in root tips maintain symmetrical growth5. When root growth deviates from the direction of gravity, the amyloplasts in the columella cells of the root cap rapidly sink to the plasma membrane at the bottom, triggering the activation of gravity response via LAZY proteins6,7. Such response entails relocation of the auxin exporter PIN-FORMED (PIN) in the cells and redistribution of auxin8–10, thus promoting asymmetric auxin flow and asymmetric cell growth to bend the root tip to the gravity direction11. Mutations in auxin transporters and gravity-signaling-related proteins often lead to defective root gravitropism during vertical growth, such as root tips growing toward random directions7,12,13, wavy roots14, and enlarged root angles15,16.",
        "methods": "The japonica rice cultivar Zhonghua11 was used as the wild type (WT) for all experiments. An ethyl methylsulfonate (EMS)-mutagenized population (M3 generation) was used for root phenotype screening. Transgenic plant materials were generated as described below. Seeds were surface sterilized with 15% NaClO for 30 min, washed with sterilized water, and placed in a 37 °C incubator for 2 days to promote germination. Germinated seeds were transferred to hydroponic boxes, soil culture boxes or agar plates to grow depending on the requirements of different experiments. Experiments were carried out in a growth room with the following conditions: temperature 28 °C ± 0.5 °C, humidity 50%–60%, 12-h photoperiod with a light intensity of 100 mmol of photons m−2 s−1. WT and mutant were also grown in two paddy fields (Nanjing and Sanya) to maturity.",
        "results": "We screened an ethyl methylsulfonate-mutagenized population (approximately 5000 lines) of the rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivar Zhonghua11 and isolated a mutant with root coiling phenotype when grown in hydroponic culture (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Movie 1). Both seminal and adventitious roots of the mutant coiled in the root tip region, resulting in a shorter root depth compared to the wild type (WT, Supplementary Fig. 1). Changes in nutrient supply, solution pH, aeration (dissolved oxygen level), and exposure to light did not alter the root coiling phenotype of the mutant in hydroponic culture (Supplementary Fig. 2). When grown in water-saturated solid media (e.g. paddy soil, soil-vermiculite mixture, vermiculite and peat pellet), however, the root coiling phenotype disappeared (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 3). We named the mutant coiling root in water (crw1).",
        "discussion": "Ethylene plays a critical role in plant growth, development and resistance to multiple biotic and abiotic stresses. Because ethylene biosynthesis fluctuates widely under the influence of changing environments18,51, its effect on gravitropic growth of roots must be tightly regulated. In this study, by dissecting the genetic basis for the root coiling phenotype in the rice mutant crw1, we uncovered the molecular module of OsCRW1 (OsEBF1)-OsEIL1/OsEIL2-OsERF82-ROS that connects ethylene signaling to gravitropism in rice roots (Fig. 8). Furthermore, by addressing why growing in soft solid media rescued root coiling phenotype of crw1, we discovered an unexpected role of root cap mechanosensing in limiting excessive ethylene signaling, thereby safeguarding gravitropic growth of rice roots (Fig. 8)."

Gravity response is inhibited in zigzag-1 (zig-1), a mutant allele of VTI11, which encodes a SNARE protein involved in vacuole fusion. zig-1 seedlings have fragmented vacuoles that fuse after treatment with wortmannin, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and underscore a role of phosphoinositides in vacuole fusion.",

        "introduction": "Plants have the capacity to sense and respond to the direction of gravity by precise modulation of growth patterns in roots and shoots (Hashiguchi et al., 2013). Gravitropism involves mechanisms of perception, signal transduction and auxin-directed differential growth.

        "introduction": "Animals rely on well-developed nervous systems to dexterously take prompt movements and rapidly facilitate long-range information exchange in front of the changing environment. In mammalian nervous systems, many different types of chemical substances, including amino acids (e.g., glutamate), monoamines (e.g., dopamine, norepinephrine), acetylcholine, peptides (e.g., substance P), serve as neurotransmitters to bind their corresponding receptors, then activate ion channels, and consequently produce ion flux1, thereby inducing membrane potential changes that lead to signal propagation for neurotransmission1–4.",

Tolerance to anoxia is relevant to wetland species, rice (Oryza sativa) cultivation, and submergence tolerance of crops. Decoding and transmitting calcium (Ca) signals may be an important component to anoxia tolerance; however, the contribution of intracellular Ca transporters to this process is poorly understood.",

The lack of oxygen (anoxia) reduces plant energy production (Rawyler et al., 2002).",

      "abstract": "Osteoporosis can profoundly affect the aged as a consequence of progressive bone loss; high-dose ionizing radiation can cause similar changes, although less is known about lower doses (≤100 cGy). We hypothesized that exposure to relatively low doses of gamma radiation accelerates structural changes characteristic of skeletal aging.",
      "sections": {
        "introduction": "Osteoporosis can lead to devastating health consequences and poses a substantial health care burden currently affecting an estimated 44 million Americans (NIH). In women, estrogen deficiency is primarily responsible for the rapid postmenopausal loss of bone mass and resulting structural fragility (type I osteoporosis) while a slower bone loss (type II or senile osteoporosis) affects both men and women late in life [1]. Bone structure begins to decline early [2]; peak bone mass is achieved in early adulthood and progressively declines in both high turnover, cancellous tissue and in the surrounding hard cortical shell.",
        "methods": "A total of 96 C57BL/6J 10-week old male mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were housed 2/cage for up to 4 months. This age and duration of the experiment were selected on the basis of results reported by others, showing that this encompasses a period of microarchitectural changes that are associated with osteopenia (reduced bone density) over time [3, 4]. Mice were provided food (LabDiet 5001, Purina Mills, Gray Summit, MO) and water ad libitum.",
        "results": "Cancellous microarchitecture was evaluated using 3D microcomputed tomography. In sham-control mice, the cancellous bone volume fraction remained constant (Figure 2(a)), bone density increased, and most microarchitectural parameters declined as the mice aged over the 4-month period of this study.",
        "discussion": "A moderate dose (100 cGy) of gamma radiation accelerated changes in the trabecular microarchitecture of postpubertal, growing (10 wk old) male C57BL/6 mice at a rate comparable to later skeletal aging in controls, whereas no effects were observed at even lower doses (1 or 10 cGy)."

In addition, microorganisms can become more virulent in space, causing further challenges to health.",

        "introduction": "Human space exploration, with its promise of unprecedented discoveries, excites the imagination. However, turning the exploration of space into a practical reality presents daunting challenges including conquering the compromised biological functions produced by spaceflight. In order to achieve space exploration, a better understanding of human biology, both on earth and in space, is required.",

      "abstract": "Isolation on Earth can alter physiology and signaling of organs systems, including the central nervous system. Although not in complete solitude, astronauts operate in an isolated environment during spaceflight. In this study, we determined the effects of isolation and simulated microgravity solely or combined, on the inflammatory cytokine milieu of the hippocampus. Adult female wild-type mice underwent simulated microgravity by hindlimb unloading for 30 days in single or social (paired) housing. In hippocampus, simulated microgravity and isolation each regulate a discrete repertoire of cytokines associated with inflammation. Their combined effects are not additive. A model for mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) quenching via targeted overexpression of the human catalase gene to the mitochondria (MCAT mice), are protected from isolation- and/or simulated microgravity-induced changes in cytokine expression. These findings suggest a key role for mitochondrial ROS signaling in neuroinflammatory responses to spaceflight and prolonged bedrest, isolation, and confinement on Earth.",
      "sections": {
        "introduction": "Isolation is an important feature of the spaceflight environment. Interplanetary missions (e.g., trip to Mars) will involve mission crew operating in isolated environments for prolonged periods of time. On Earth, isolation has profound effects on the central nervous system (CNS) including behavioral changes, upregulated oxidative stress pathways, neuroinflammatory responses, as well as brain cytokine alterations1–3. In addition, isolation worsens aging-related cognitive impairments and immune deficits4. Spaceflight also can lead to immune dysfunction as well as reactivation of latent viruses5–8. International Space Station (ISS) crew members on a 6-month spaceflight mission had diminished T/NK cell function9 and increased inflammatory plasma cytokine levels10. In shorter duration missions (9–14 days), changes in the distribution and function of peripheral leukocytes were also detected in astronauts11. Further, the subset of astronauts who experienced viral shedding also displayed increased plasma cytokine protein levels in their plasma during flight12, linking dysregulated cytokine levels with impaired immune function.",
        "methods": "Female wild-type C57BL/6NJ and MCAT transgenic mice were included in this study. MCAT mice overexpress human catalase localized to the mitochondria15. Wild type (WT) and MCAT mice for use in the experiments were generated at NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) by crossing male MCAT mice, B6.Cg-Tg (CAG-OTC/CAT) 4033Prab/J with female C57BL/6NJ mice (from Jackson Laboratory; stocks 016197 and 005304, respectively). Genotyping was performed using the Red’N Amp PCR kit following the manufacturer’s protocol (Millipore-Sigma). All animal procedures were performed in compliance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at ARC. The approved animal protocols associated with this study are NAS-16-006 and NAS-16-007.",
        "results": "We performed unbiased hierarchical clustering of cytokine protein expression to gain insight into the impacts of our main experimental variables, loading state (NL: normally loaded or HU), housing environment (single or social housing), and genotype (WT: wild type or MCAT) on the overall cytokine milieu in the hippocampus (Fig. 1). At the highest hierarchical level, samples generally clustered by housing conditions (single or social). Samples within the single housed cluster, formed sub-clusters mostly based on genotype (WT or MCAT), which was not observed in the social housed cluster. Loading state (NL or HU) did not appear to contribute to observed clustering of cytokine expression.",
        "discussion": "Although not in complete solitude, human crew in deep space missions will experience prolonged exposure to environments isolated from Earth and larger social groups. Using a rodent model, we assessed the consequence of isolation alone or in combination with simulated microgravity on the CNS cytokine milieu, a key component of the neuroimmune response. In addition, we sought to determine whether mitochondrial ROS signaling contributed to cytokine responses in the CNS focusing on the hippocampus. Spaceflight is known to cause dysfunction in a variety of tissues52–57. Various regions of the CNS are negatively impacted by microgravity and its simulations. For example, 14 days of HU increased acetylcholine activity in both hippocampus and cortex, which was linked to inferior behavior performances47,58. Our results suggest that isolation is an important stimulus that can evoke changes in the cytokine milieu of the hippocampus, with 11 of 44 immune-modulating cytokines tested showing increased protein expression due to isolation. We also found that compared to social housed mice, isolation increased 4-HNE, an indicator of oxidative damage. Together, these findings indicate that isolation can alter aspects of CNS immune signaling and lead to increased oxidative damage in the CNS."

      "abstract": "N6-threonylcarbamoyl-adenosine (t6A) is one of the few RNA modifications that is universally present in life. This modification occurs at high frequency at position 37 of most tRNAs that decode ANN codons, and stabilizes cognate anticodon–codon interactions. Nearly all genetic studies of the t6A pathway have focused on single-celled organisms. In this study, we report the isolation of an extensive allelic series in the Drosophila ortholog of the core t6A biosynthesis factor Kae1. kae1 hemizygous larvae exhibit decreases in t6A that correlate with allele strength; however, we still detect substantial t6A-modified tRNAs even during the extended larval phase of null alleles. Nevertheless, complementation of Drosophila Kae1 and other t6A factors in corresponding yeast null mutants demonstrates that these metazoan genes execute t6A synthesis. Turning to the biological consequences of t6A loss, we characterize prominent kae1 melanotic masses and show that they are associated with lymph gland overgrowth and ectopic generation of lamellocytes. On the other hand, kae1 mutants exhibit other phenotypes that reflect insufficient tissue growth. Interestingly, whole-tissue and clonal analyses show that strongly mitotic tissues such as imaginal discs are exquisitely sensitive to loss of kae1, whereas nonproliferating tissues are less affected. Indeed, despite overt requirements of t6A for growth of many tissues, certain strong kae1 alleles achieve and sustain enlarged body size during their extended larval phase. Our studies highlight tissue-specific requirements of the t6A pathway in a metazoan context and provide insights into the diverse biological roles of this fundamental RNA modification during animal development and disease.",

        "introduction": "Beyond the four canonical ribonucleosides present in RNA, nearly all life forms bear an array of modified bases in various transcript populations. Over 100 chemical modifications have been documented, with dozens often present in individual species; the majority of distinct modified ribonucleosides occur on tRNA (Machnicka et al. 2013). Altogether, RNA modifications collectively play diverse roles in RNA quality control, secondary structure, transcript stability, translational efficiency, translational fidelity, and regulation of RNA–protein interactions (Gu et al. 2014; Hopper and Huang 2015) and can influence disease and cancer progression (Grewal 2015; Kirchner and Ignatova 2015).",
        "methods": "The region uncovered by Df(3L)ED220 was subjected to a lethal F2 screen after EMS mutagenesis. In total, we conducted nine rounds of mutagenesis using isogenized w[1118] males (rounds 1 and 2) or w ; FRT80B males (subsequent rounds). The animals were desiccated and fed 25mM EMS in 20% sucrose, then mated with w; TM3 Sb/TM6B females. Individual F1 TM6B males were crossed to w; Df(3L)ED220 w+/TM6B females (Bloomington #8077). Vials were scored for lethality by the absence of empty non-Tb pupal cases. Owing to the w+ marker integral to Df(3L)ED220, stocks of new lethal alleles were recovered by collecting white-eyed flies carrying TM6B, and re-balancing. In total, we conducted nine rounds of mutagenesis, and scored >7000 viable crosses to the deficiency, yielding 64 lethals.",
        "results": "During efforts to isolate mutants in the 72D-F region, we conducted an F2 EMS mutagenesis screen against Df(3L)ED220, which deletes 324,210 bp of chromosome 3L:16,080,584–16,404,777 (see Materials and Methods). We screened ∼7000 crosses of animals bearing mutagenized chromosomes to this deficiency, and recovered 64 lethals. Within this collection, we recognized numerous alleles for which hemizygous larvae bore characteristic melanotic masses, which we colloquially termed “Black Spot” mutants (Fig. 1A). These mutants failed to complement each other, and they typically exhibited an extended larval period prior to lethality (Fig. 1B–D; Supplemental Fig. 1). Notably, while Drosophila larvae complete their larval stages around day 5 and commence pupation, some Black Spot mutants survive as larvae for up to 18 d. Systematic tests against all of the lethal alleles we obtained in this genomic interval revealed additional noncomplementing mutations. Many of these mutants lacked black spots or generated them with low frequency (Fig. 1B–D). Several of these alleles were able to develop to pupal stages or even into pharate adults as hemizygotes, suggesting they might represent hypomorphs. Overall, these eight alleles appear to represent an extensive allelic series.",
        "discussion": "To date, nearly all studies of the t6A biogenesis pathway have been conducted in unicellular organisms such as bacteria or yeast. The first functional study of a metazoan t6A component involved knockdown of the mitochondrial Kae1 paralog Qri7 (OSGEP-L) in Caenorhabditis elegans, which induced defective mitochondrial morphology and function (Oberto et al. 2009). Subsequently, a knockdown study of the D. melanogaster Bud32/PRPK reported growth defects relating to defective TOR signaling (Ibar et al. 2013). However, neither study assessed biochemical defects in t6A accumulation per se. Furthermore, knockdown approaches do not generally achieve genetic null states."

      "abstract": "Leptopilina heterotoma are obligate parasitoid wasps that develop in the body of their Drosophila hosts. During oviposition, female wasps introduce venom into the larval hosts’ body cavity. The venom contains discrete, 300 nm-wide, mixed-strategy extracellular vesicles (MSEVs), until recently referred to as virus-like particles. While the crucial immune suppressive functions of L. heterotoma MSEVs have remained undisputed, their biotic nature and origin still remain controversial. In recent proteomics analyses of L. heterotoma MSEVs, we identified 161 proteins in three classes: conserved eukaryotic proteins, infection and immunity related proteins, and proteins without clear annotation. Here we report 246 additional proteins from the L. heterotoma MSEV proteome. An enrichment analysis of the entire proteome supports vesicular nature of these structures. Sequences for more than 90% of these proteins are present in the whole-body transcriptome. Sequencing and de novo assembly of the 460 Mb-sized L. heterotoma genome revealed 90% of MSEV proteins have coding regions within the genomic scaffolds. Altogether, these results explain the stable association of MSEVs with their wasps, and like other wasp structures, their vertical inheritance. While our results do not rule out a viral origin of MSEVs, they suggest that a similar strategy for co-opting cellular machinery for immune suppression may be shared by other wasps to gain advantage over their hosts. These results are relevant to our understanding of the evolution of figitid and related wasp species.",

(2012). Adult wasps were collected from parasitized hosts, 25 days after infection at 25°. Male and female wasps were stored on fly food with 70% honey on “buzz” plugs.",
        "results": "A comparative study of the proteomes of the MSEVs from Lh 14 and Lh NY strains previously generated a list of 161 “common” MSEV proteins (Heavner et al. 2017). More than 90% of the 161 proteins are part of the Lh 14 MSEV proteome. To describe MSEVs more completely, we characterized a larger set of 407 MSEV proteins from Lh 14 (161 common and 246 Lh 14) and define this set as the Lh MSEV “super-set” (Figure 1A). Key results from annotation-based classification, analysis for signal peptide and/or transmembrane domain, and presence/absence of proteins in related wasps are summarized below and in Table S1.",
        "discussion": "The superset of MSEV proteins: (A) Lh 14 MSEV proteins were annotated using BLAST2GO prior to class sorting via annotation and GO Terms. Wedges denoted as “Common,” were previously published in (Heavner et al. 2017) and represent proteins found in both Lh 14 and Lh NY MSEV proteomes. New proteins analyzed in this work are in wedges labeled “Lh 14 Only.” A majority of proteins belong to Class 1. Table S1 lists 246 proteins added to the superset Lh 14 proteome. (B) and (C) Enrichment analysis of MSEV superset shows high association with exosomes and mitochondria compared to other cellular organelles according to Vesiclepedia. –log 10 (p-value) trend shown in orange for both graphs. The p-values were calculated with the Bonferroni method. (B) Percentage of MSEV genes associated with specific cellular compartments found in Vesiclepedia, relative to all MSEV genes. Of the superset proteins, 41 and 49% are associated with mitochondria and exosomes, respectively (P = 3 × 10−57; 1 × 10−53). (C) Fold-enrichment of the MSEV dataset in specific cellular compartments. Although many protein classes are present in the proteome, exosomal and mitochondrial proteins show more significant enrichments."

Homeostasis in bone occurs through a balance in the activities and signaling of osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and osteocytes, as well as proliferation and differentiation of their stem cell progenitors. Microgravity and unloading are known to cause osteoclast-mediated bone resorption; however, we hypothesize that osteocytic osteolysis, and cell cycle arrest during osteogenesis may also contribute to bone loss in space.",

Robust immune physiology and intact genomes are vital to the success of manned space exploration efforts. Animals and plants harbor a diverse array of microbial and metazoan pathogens and parasites. While the effects of the space environment in low Earth orbit are documented on many host species, with a focus on humans,1 the effects of space on the accompanying pathogens and parasites are not known.",

        "discussion": "American scientists first launched fruit flies into space in 1947, and since then more than 20 spaceflight experiments with fruit flies have been conducted.4 Even parasitic wasps have been to space: in 1967, Biosatellite II carried Habrobracon juglandis into space.53"

Biological effects of spaceflight on cells and organisms, on the other hand, are much harder to define [1, 2].",

      "abstract": "Baker’s yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) has broad genetic homology to human cells. Although typically grown as 1-2mm diameter colonies under certain conditions yeast can form very large (10 + mm in diameter) or ‘giant’ colonies on agar. Giant yeast colonies have been used to study diverse biomedical processes such as cell survival, aging, and the response to cancer pharmacogenomics.",
      "sections": {
        "introduction": "The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has broad genomic homology to human cells and is simple to grow and genetically manipulate (Lee et al. 2014; Kachroo et al. 2015; Nislow et al. 2015). This has made it a powerful model organism with biomedical applications to understand mechanisms of cell-to-cell interactions, cell survival, and aging (Cap et al. 2009a; Ayer et al. 2014; Herker et al. 2004).",
        "methods": "Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain BY4743 (i.e., wild type (WT)), was used to match our earlier studies (Hammond et al. 2015). This parental strain, as well as Msn4 deletion, Sfp1 deletion, BEM1-eGFP and TRR1-eGFP yeast clones were purchased from Life Technologies (Grand Island, NY).",
        "results": "Expression of the stress response genes, SSA4 and RPL34b, was measured using eGFP fusion protein expression clones. Stress promoter dependence was assessed by comparing the eGFP signal of the parent strains to clones in which the Msn4 or Sfp1 promoter genes had been deleted (Fig. 2 and Table 2).",
        "discussion": "Systematic studies of the effects of true microgravity and common microgravity simulations on cell physiology has been lacking. Furthermore, how these environments combine with other fundamental variables such as growth media to influence the cellular response to stress is an outstanding question."

        "introduction": "Space exploration is a long-term dream and pursuit of humanity, and it is also one of the important fields of technological development. In long-term space flight, astronauts face many problems. One of them is the reduction of gravitational force. Terrestrial life has evolved under the influence of gravity for millions of years, and long-term microgravity represents unusual stress experiences that can cause physiological and morphological changes1. Numerous studies have shown that long-term weightlessness can lead to various physiological and pathological changes, such as the skeletal and muscular system, cardiovascular system, immune system, and nervous system2. Prolonged exposure to microgravity during extended space missions poses various physiological challenges to astronauts, necessitating thorough research into the effects of microgravity on the human body. One of the crucial issues is the impact of long-term spaceflight on brain function. Studies have shown that astronauts experience changes such as ataxia, posture disorders, perceptual illusions, fatigue, and cognitive impairment3. The high cost and technical issues related to spaceflight have stimulated the development of ground models that reasonably simulate the effects of space flight. Currently, tail-suspension hindlimb unloading is the most classic and widely used model, particularly those affecting the musculoskeletal system4. However, this model has certain limitations, that is, it can only be applied locally, and cannot be applied to the whole experimental animal. Besides, there are physiological differences between hindlimb unloading models and spaceflight, especially in terms of somatosensory input, spatial orientation, and vestibular disruption5.",
        "methods": "10-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were purchased from Beijing HFK Bioscience Co., Ltd and kept in the experimental room at temperature 22 ± 2 °C, humidity 40 ± 5%, under a 12-h light/dark cycle. The mice were randomly divided into three groups: (1) MC group with mice housed in ordinary cage (MC, n = 6); (2) SB group with mice housed in survival box (SB, n = 6); (3) CS group with mice housed in survival box receiving 3D clinostat treatment (CS, n = 6). The structure of the 3D clinostat and the survival box (shown in Supplementary Figure S1) has been described in detail in our previous study10. The rotation modes are as follows: random rotation speed, 0–10 rpm; speed resolution, 0.1 rpm. Before the study, all mice were acclimated to the facility environment for 2 days and then adaptive training was carried out for 5 days to alleviate stress and adapt to the jelly like diet containing 59% water, 1% agar, and 40% purified feed. During training, the CS group underwent adaptive rotation for 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 8 h, and 12 h each day, while the MC group was always placed in ordinary cage and the SB group was always placed in survival boxes without any treatment. The formal experiments began at 11 weeks old. The CS group experienced continuous simulated microgravity effect on clinostat for 8 weeks with the exception of cleaning cages and changing food for approximately 20 min per day; the other two groups of mice always lived in corresponding living facilities in the same room. To avoid the interference of acute stress, weight monitoring showed that the body weight of mice in the CS group gradually returned to the control group level after 28 days, suggesting that the mice had fully adapted to the 3D clinostat. Starting from the fifth week, mice underwent a series of behavioral experiments. Following each behavioral experiment, the mice were promptly placed into a 3D clinostat to ensure continuous microgravity effect stimulation. After 8 weeks, the mice were euthanized dissected for sampling.",
        "results": "Figure 1b showed the daily changes in weight of mice over the first 4 weeks. The SB group mice exhibited a weight profile similar to that of the MC group, indicating good adaptability to survival box. In contrast, the CS group mice undergoing 3D clinostat initially experienced a significant weight loss during the first 4 days. However, these mice gradually adapted to the 3D clinostat and their weight stabilized, followed by a slow recovery to levels similar to those of the SB control group and MC control group. Overall, the mice appeared healthy throughout the study period, indicating good adaptability to the 3D clinostat instrument.",
        "discussion": "This study explored the impact of simulated microgravity effect using a 3D clinostat on mice, with a particular focus on behavioral, metabolic, gut microbiome and brain transcriptome changes. Our findings revealed that the simulated microgravity effect induced by the 3D clinostat triggered noteworthy transformations within the central nervous system. This model has the potential to serve as a valuable tool for investigating cognitive changes associated with microgravity environments, while also offering new insights into the potential mechanisms underlying spaceflight-related health risks."

      "abstract": "Waterborne pathogenic mycobacteria can form biofilms, and certain species can cause hard-to-treat human lung infections. Astronaut health could therefore be compromised if the spacecraft environment or water becomes contaminated with pathogenic mycobacteria. This work uses Mycobacterium marinum to determine the physiological changes in a pathogenic mycobacteria grown under low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG). M. marinum were grown in high aspect ratio vessels (HARVs) using a rotary cell culture system subjected to LSMMG or the control orientation (normal gravity, NG) and the cultures used to determine bacterial growth, bacterium size, transcriptome changes, and resistance to stress.",
      "sections": {
        "introduction": "Recent studies have demonstrated that the spacecraft environment can be contaminated with numerous microbial species.1 Samples to check for microbes are frequently taken from surfaces, air, and water on the International Space Station (ISS) and tests to identify bacterial species include sequencing of 16s rRNA and culturing viable bacteria.1,2 A variety of bacterial phyla have been identified including Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Cyanobacteria, Acidobacteria, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, SR1, Tenericutes, and TM7 and a number of genera have been identified within each phylum.1 The bacteria most frequently found on the ISS include species of Staphylococcus, Bacillus, and Micrococcus.2 Experiments to determine the effect of spaceflight or low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG) on bacteria have determined that different phenotypes are induced in different types of bacteria.",
        "methods": "M. marinum strain 1218R,53 a strain isolated from infected fish, and a derivative of this strain, LHM4, were used for this study. LHM4 carries an integrated plasmid pDEAM2, which encodes red fluorescent protein and confers kanamycin resistance. Bacteria were grown in the dark at 30 °C in tubes in a rotating incubator (120 r.p.m.)27 or in HARVs attached to a rotating cell culture system (RCCS, Synthecon, Houston, TX, USA) in Middlebrook 7H9 broth (Difco, Detroit, MI, USA) supplemented with ADS (5% BSA Fraction V, 2% Dextrose, 0.81% NaCl) to 10%, 0.5% glycerol, 100 μg cycloheximide/ml, and 0.2% Tween 80.",
        "results": "The effect of LSMMG exposure time had to be assessed with bacteria in the same phase of growth, as we found stress resistance altered as the M. marinum progressed from early to late exponential phase (data not shown) and it would be expected that the transcriptome of replicating bacteria is very different from bacteria in stationary phase.",
        "discussion": "Previous studies examining liquid bacterial growth during space travel3 or LSMMG2,3 have found species-specific alterations: LSMMG-grown S. typhimurium had decreased doubling time in minimal medium,29 Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis reached higher cell densities and had increased growth rate during spaceflight compared with ground controls,45 while S. aureus achieved higher cell densities in the normal gravity control compared with the LSMMG culture.12 In our study, in a 4-day continuous growth culture, M. marinum subjected to NG achieved a higher cell density than the LSMMG culture."

      "abstract": "Unlike typical negative gravitropic curvature, young hypocotyls of Brassica rapa and other dicots exhibit positive gravitropism. This positive curvature occurs at the base of the hypocotyl and is followed by the typical negative gravity-induced curvature.",
      "sections": {
        "introduction": "Gravitropism is defined as a directional growth response of plants to gravity. This force affects the redistribution of statoliths (starch-filled amyloplasts) in sensory cells and determines the positioning of the plant axis during and after germination.",
        "methods": "Seeds of Brassica rapa vs. rapa were germinated at 25 °C in darkness between germination paper that was positioned on top of five mm thick floral foam to avoid thigmotropic stimulation of roots upon emergence.",
        "results": "RNA extraction of tissue was performed along the upper and lower flank of the basal hypocotyl from tissue extraction or by Solid Phase Gene Extraction (Figure 1).",
        "discussion": "The transcription of PIN1, PIN3, IAA5 and ARG1 varied during the graviresponse of B. rapa and is likely mediated by auxin as auxin-induced elongation along the convex side of hypocotyls coincides with the upregulation of these genes, while the concave side shows the reduction in transcription."

        "introduction": "The mechanisms that regulate bone growth and mineralization remain poorly understood. The cellular events involved in bone formation include chemotaxis of osteoblast precursors, growth factor (GF) production, proliferation of committed osteoblast precursors, and the differentiation (mineralization) of osteoblasts.",

      "abstract": "Altered immune function has been demonstrated in astronauts during spaceflights dating back to Apollo and Skylab; this could be a major barrier to long-term space exploration. We tested the hypothesis that spaceflight causes changes in microRNA (miRNA) expression. Human leukocytes were stimulated with mitogens on board the International Space Station using an onboard normal gravity control. Bioinformatics showed that miR-21 was significantly up-regulated 2-fold during early T-cell activation in normal gravity, and gene expression was suppressed under microgravity. This was confirmed using quantitative real-time PCR (n = 4). This is the first report that spaceflight regulates miRNA expression. Global microarray analysis showed significant (P < 0.05) suppression of 85 genes under microgravity conditions compared to normal gravity samples. EGR3, FASLG, BTG2, SPRY2, and TAGAP are biologically confirmed targets and are co-up-regulated with miR-21. These genes share common promoter regions with pre-mir-21; as the miR-21 matures and accumulates, it most likely will inhibit translation of its target genes and limit the immune response. These data suggest that gravity regulates T-cell activation not only by transcription promotion but also by blocking translation via noncoding RNA mechanisms. Moreover, this study suggests that T-cell activation itself may induce a sequence of gene expressions that is self-limited by miR-21.—Hughes-Fulford, M., Chang, T. T., Martinez, E. M., Li, C.-F. Spaceflight alters expression of microRNA during T-cell activation.",

        "introduction": "",
        "methods": "Whole peripheral blood was obtained from 4 human donors between the ages of 21 and 55 years. All were in good health, and none was taking medication at the time of donation; no personal health identifiers were recorded. This study was reviewed and approved by the University of California, San Francisco, Committee on Human Research. Red blood cells were lysed and peripheral blood leukocytes isolated using Ficoll gradients. Human T cells were further purified using enrichment columns per manufacturer’s instructions (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA), which isolate CD3+ T cells to 90% or greater purity. Human T cells were resuspended into RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal calf serum and loaded at 6 × 10^6 cells per chamber into the spaceflight hardware, Lycis. The spaceflight hardware consisted of 8 cassettes, each with 4 chambers. Some units had smart-button temperature data storage capability, and temperatures of the containers were tracked for the duration of the mission. Purified T cells from each donor were kept separate and loaded into 4 individual chambers in separate cassettes for the following treatments: microgravity nonactivated, microgravity activated, 0.5 g activated, and normal gravity activated. Units were loaded and handed over to the Russian team 14 h before launch and were stored in insulated pouches. The experimental units were launched into space on board the Soyuz 13S rocket from Baikonur, Kazakhstan, on September 18, 2006. Before the in-flight experimental procedures, cassettes were kept in ambient temperatures, which ranged from 16 to 22°C. Cassettes were transferred to the ISS immediately after docking of the Soyuz vehicle on September 20 (flight day 3) and placed into the Kubik incubator centrifuge at 36.5°C. All samples were preincubated at 36.5°C for 30 min. The normal gravity and 0.5 g units were placed in the central centrifuge positions and centrifuged with an applied normal gravity or 0.5 g force, respectively. The microgravity units were placed in the outer centrifuge positions.",
        "results": "Using bioinformatics, we analyzed the gene expression T-cell activation of 3 individual human donors under normal gravity on board, and microgravity conditions that were incubated, activated, and fixed on the ISS. In our initial bioinformatics analysis, we found that there was 1 miRNA that had reduced gene expression in true microgravity; in normal gravity, miR-21 was increased 2-fold, while in microgravity miR-21 was not significantly changed compared to onboard normal gravity controls (n = 4). This gene array analysis was confirmed by mirVana qRT-PCR. Expression was corrected to internal standard 5S rRNA. A small amount of mRNA from 0.5 g onboard samples (n = 4) was available for analysis. With a 0.5 g fractional gravity, the expression of miR-21 was increased over the microgravity sample.",
        "discussion": "miRNAs are a class of small noncoding RNAs that act as posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression and play fundamental roles in regulating immune response and autoimmunity (17). In the data presented here, we show for the first time an altered profile of miRNA expression under true microgravity compared to its onboard normal gravity controls; all samples were isolated from donors on earth, incubated, activated, and fixed in ISS on-orbit operations. The miR-21 differential expression seen in the global gene analysis was confirmed by mirVana qRT-PCR (Fig. 3). Of interest, samples from onboard 0.5 g samples demonstrated that fractional gravity is capable of restoring gene expression of miR-21."

      "abstract": "In immunocompromised individuals, Aspergillus fumigatus causes invasive fungal disease that is often difficult to treat. Exactly how immune mechanisms control A. fumigatus in immunocompetent individuals remains unclear. Here, we use transparent zebrafish larvae to visualize and quantify neutrophil and macrophage behaviors in response to different A. fumigatus strains. We find that macrophages form dense clusters around spores, establishing a protective niche for fungal survival. Macrophages exert these protective effects by inhibiting fungal germination, thereby inhibiting subsequent neutrophil recruitment and neutrophil-mediated killing. Germination directly drives fungal clearance as faster-growing CEA10-derived strains are killed better in vivo than slower-growing Af293-derived strains. Additionally, a CEA10 pyrG-deficient strain with impaired germination is cleared less effectively by neutrophils. Host inflammatory activation through Myd88 is required for killing of a CEA10-derived strain but not sufficient for killing of an Af293-derived strain, further demonstrating the role of fungal-intrinsic differences in the ability of a host to clear an infection. Altogether, we describe a new role for macrophages in the persistence of A. fumigatus and highlight the ability of different A. fumigatus strains to adopt diverse modes of virulence.",
      "sections": {
        "introduction": "Humans inhale hundreds of Aspergillus fumigatus spores from the environment every day and yet almost all immunocompetent individuals successfully contend with the fungal infection. Immunocompromised patients, however, especially acute leukemia patients, hematopoietic cell transplant recipients, and solid-organ transplant recipients, are at risk of developing invasive aspergillosis [1]. In invasive disease, Aspergillus spores germinate into filamentous hyphae and invade and destroy tissues and organs, with mortality rates as high as 50 to 60% in patient populations [1]. Limited antifungal treatments exist and there is growing resistance among fungi to these drugs [2]. The development of successful immunotherapy-based treatments to this infection requires a more comprehensive understanding of the interplay of immune mechanisms that control Aspergillus in vivo.",
        "methods": "Animal care and use protocol M005405-A02 was approved by the University of Wisconsin-Madison College of Agricultural and Life Sciences (CALS) Animal Care and Use Committee. This protocol adheres to the federal Health Research Extension Act and the Public Health Service Policy on the Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, overseen by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW).",
        "results": "Differences in the virulence of two common lab strains isolated from patients, Af293 and CEA10, have been reported, but the mechanisms underlying these differences remain incompletely understood [26–28]. In particular, the ability of wild-type hosts to contend with and clear these two different infections is not known. To investigate such clearance, we decided to apply a published method to visually quantify Aspergillus spore killing [10], to our established model of Aspergillus infection in transparent zebrafish larvae [21], giving us the ability to visualize fungal killing in a live, intact host.",
        "discussion": "Here we have used larval zebrafish to image Aspergillus fumigatus infection in live, intact hosts, over the course of a multi-day infection to visualize and quantify both immune cell behavior and fungal development and growth. Using a method to visually quantify spore killing, we find that faster-growing CEA10-derived strains of A. fumigatus are cleared significantly better than slower-growing Af293-derived strains."

        "introduction": "Space exploration is one of the most fascinating enterprises for humans. It is becoming increasingly evident that plants are an essential companion of humans in space exploration as a privileged source of high quality nutrients and oxygen as well as waste recycling systems, that is, as a key component of bioregenerative life support systems (Fu et al., 2016). Thus, the search for the most efficient way of cultivating plants in space, including the knowledge of the mechanisms of adaptation of plants to the space environment and the careful selection of plant species, varieties and genetic lines, are current major challenges of plant space research (Medina et al., 2021). The most difficult parameter to overcome in the space environment is altered gravity level, because all other parameters such as oxygen and nutrient levels, humidity, temperature, or light conditions can be adjusted. Only cosmic radiation represents a challenge comparable to gravity because of the lack of 100% effective protective shields. On the other hand, plants, like every organism on Earth, have evolved under a constant gravity level and its modification or absence may be a difficult challenge to overcome for an organism.",

        "results": "",
        "discussion": "In the last decade, the landscape of plant biology research in spaceflight and simulated microgravity research has greatly advanced, mostly with the incorporation of space transcriptomics tools such as RNAseq and microarrays. The aim of this review was therefore to revise the knowledge acquired through these techniques. The focus and organization of the work around the hardware used in the various experiments facilitated the comparison of the numerous results obtained and made it possible the identification of gene expression networks leading to a better knowledge of the plant adaptation mechanisms to spaceflight conditions. The report also highlighted the European contribution in the acquisition of this knowledge."

In early studies, these movements were first characterized by Darwin and Darwin (1880), however, description of plant movement actually dates back to the Ancient Romans (Ovid 8 AD 2008). Plants exhibit these growth-mediated responses to external cues, including water (hydrotropism, Kiss 2007), touch or contact (thigmotropism, Braam 2005), the sun or light (heliotropism and phototropism, respectively Briggs 1964; Vandenbrink et al. 2014a, b; Kutschera and Briggs 2016), and gravity (gravitropism, Chen et al. 1999; Kiss 2000) among others.",

Recent studies in human (i.e., NASA Twin Study, Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019) and mammalian systems (rodent missions, Beheshti et al., 2019; Ronca et al., 2019) are paving the way to understand the effects of the microgravity environment on human physiology, but human life in space will rely on the essential role of plants in bioregenerative life support systems (Zabel et al., 2016), not only as a source of water, food, and removal of CO2 but also by providing a terrestrial-like environment for the psychological well-being of astronauts.",

Seedlings were germinated in the same spaceflight hardware during 4 days with a day/night cycle of illumination, and then half of the samples were exposed to 2 days of darkness and the other group to 2 days of continuous red light (Figure 1A).",
        "discussion": "Major constraints of spaceflight experiments are the reduced amount of material and reproducibility, but other issues include the storage of samples before and after the experiment execution in space, causing staggered preparation and processing of the samples (Millar et al., 2010; Correll et al., 2013)."

        "introduction": "The presence of humans in space has considerably increased since the beginning of space conquest and the space population is expected to continue to grow with tourism and private research activities. The NASA Artemis program plans to take humans back to the Moon for 2024, and a walk on Mars soil is estimated in the course of the 2030s (Bukley, 2020). Meanwhile, space research is driving more and more astronauts in low Earth orbit as an invaluable tool used to deepen humanity’s understanding of the universe and our place within it. But not only do humans want to visit and explore space, humans want to live in space. Outer space settlement has become a new goal of space agencies and the private sector. The Artemis program, SpaceX, the Moon Village Association, and the Mars Society are examples of the driving force of human performance in space. Recently, the USA Air Force Space Command reported eight most plausible scenarios to the year 2060, all of which anticipating a permanent occupation of the Moon surface ranging from a small-sized crew to colony of thousands of people (Air Force Space Command, 2019). Over fifty years after the first foot imprint on the lunar surface, humans could very soon become an interplanetary species.",

        "results": "Lipid metabolic processes are the most commonly biological processes affected in mice quadriceps and liver during spaceflight",
        "discussion": "Despite the systemic and physiological health risk of spaceflight, it is a fact that humans have become a space-faring species. Muscle atrophy has been shown to occur in both weightlessness and bed rest studies. The decreased gravity load on the locomotive apparatus is often presented as the main driver of muscle atrophy and bone loss. Previous studies showed that mitochondrial function and lipid metabolism were impaired in both astronauts and mice during spaceflight. Da Silveira and colleagues previously showed that a mitochondrial stress is a central hub for spaceflight-induced physiological changes (da Silveira et al., 2020)."

      "abstract": "Apoptosis plays an important role in atrophy and sarcopenia in skeletal muscle. Recent evidence suggests that insufficient heat shock proteins (HSPs) may contribute to apoptosis and muscle wasting. In addition, long-term caloric restriction (CR) and lifelong wheel running exercise (WR) with CR provide significant protection against caspase-dependent apoptosis and sarcopenia. Caspase-independent mediators (endonuclease G: EndoG; apoptosis-inducing factor: AIF) of apoptosis are also linked to muscles wasting with disuse and aging. However, the efficacy of CR and WR with CR to attenuate caspase-independent apoptosis and preserve HSPs in aging skeletal muscle are unknown.",
      "sections": {
        "introduction": "Skeletal muscles in mammals suffer from a progressive loss of muscle mass and function with advancing age, a process known as sarcopenia. The mechanisms responsible for sarcopenia are believed to be multi-factorial. From an epidemiological standpoint, impaired neuromuscular (e.g., loss of β-motor neurons) and endocrine (e.g., low testosterone, growth hormone, thyroxine levels, and increased insulin resistance) function, poor nutritional status, and physical inactivity have all been implicated (Dreyer and Volpi 2005; Lee and others 2007; Szulc and others 2004). At the cellular level, a host of etiological candidates driving sarcopenia include apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, and insufficient stress response including heat shock proteins (HSPs) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) (Jensen 2008; Marzetti and others 2008b).",
        "methods": "Male Fischer 344 rats were purchased from the Harlan colony (Indianapolis, IN) at 10–11 weeks of age. Animal Care Services facilities and all procedures had been approved by the University of Florida’s Institute on Animal Care and Use Committee. All rats were singly housed in a pathogen-free conditioned room in a temperature 20±2.5°C, and kept on a room with a 12h light: 12h dark diurnal cycle. Water and rat chow (Harlan Teklad Rodent Diet #8604) composed of a high protein (24.5%), carbohydrate including hemicelluloses (46.6%), low fat (4.4%), vitamins and minerals were given to animals and food intake for the caloric restricted groups and wheel running + caloric restriction groups was reduced by 8% below compared with age-matched ad libitum group.",
        "results": "We quantified EndoG and AIF protein levels in the plantaris muscle of the YAL, OAL, OCR, and OExCR rats. The protein abundance for EndoG in the soluble (mitochondrial) fraction was not different in old control (OAL; +17%) compared with young control (YAL). Further, EndoG was not affected by caloric restriction and lifelong wheel running (Figure 1A). However, there was a striking increase (+153%, p<0.001) in EndoG protein level in nucleosome fraction with age in the ad libitum group (Figure 1B). When we tested the effectiveness of long-term interventions, 8% caloric restriction attenuated the age-associated increase in the levels of EndoG in nuclear fraction (−38%, p=0.002). In addition, lifelong wheel running exercise with mild caloric restriction also mitigated upregulation of nuclear EndoG levels (−46%, p<0.001). Thus mild caloric restriction and exercise with caloric restriction may slow or prevent age-induced increase in pro-apoptotic EndoG signaling by limiting translocation from cytosol to nucleus.",
        "discussion": "The main objective of this study was to examine the effect of lifelong mild caloric restriction and voluntary wheel running exercise with caloric restriction on caspase-independent apoptosis. We also determined whether age-associated dysregulation of heat shock proteins is a potential protective mechanism against age-induced elevation of caspase-independent apoptotic signaling in skeletal muscle. A primary finding was that both lifelong mild caloric restriction and wheel running exercise with caloric restriction effectively abrogated age-induced translocation or accumulation of EndoG in the nucleus. This is highly novel data, suggesting that part of the amelioration of apoptosis by caloric restriction and long-term exercise demonstrated previously in the literature (Marzetti and others 2008b) is linked to prevention of nuclear EndoG accumulation in skeletal muscle nuclei."

      "abstract": "Control over phenoxy radical-radical coupling reactions in vivo in vascular plants was enigmatic until our discovery of dirigent proteins (DPs, from the Latin dirigere, to guide or align). The first three-dimensional structure of a DP ((+)-pinoresinol-forming DP, 1.95 Å resolution, rhombohedral space group H32)) is reported herein. It has a tightly packed trimeric structure with an eight-stranded β-barrel topology for each DP monomer. Each putative substrate binding and orientation coupling site is located on the trimer surface but too far apart for intermolecular coupling between sites. It is proposed that each site enables stereoselective coupling (using either two coniferyl alcohol radicals or a radical and a monolignol). Interestingly, there are six differentially conserved residues in DPs affording either the (+)- or (−)-antipodes in the vicinity of the putative binding site and region known to control stereoselectivity. DPs are involved in lignan biosynthesis, whereas dirigent domains/sites have been implicated in lignin deposition.",
      "sections": {
        "introduction": "In terrestrial vascular plants, monolignol coupling affords the lignans (1), as well as the polymeric structural lignins (2), with the latter being the most abundant plant biopolymers next to cellulose. The former are, however, a very diverse class of vascular plant natural products, typically dimers and/or higher oligomers, whose physiological roles in planta are considered mainly involved in plant defense, particularly in leaf, (heart)wood, knot, and seed coat tissues. Many lignans are optically active and can have diverse coupling modes, although the 8–8′ interunit (dimer) linkage is perhaps the most commonly encountered (1). Some are also medicinally important, such as podophyllotoxin, or its semi-synthetic derivatives, etoposide, teniposide, and Etopophos® widely used in cancer therapies (1).",
        "methods": "The PsDRR206 gene (GenBankTM accession number U11716) was isolated from pea (P. sativum cv. Alcan) genomic DNA using PCR amplification with gene specific primers (DRR206 forward, ATGGGTTCCAAACTTCTAGTACTA, and DRR206 reverse, TTACCAACACTCAAAGAACTTGAT). Vector construction and transformation were carried out using biolistic bombardment technology as described by Seneviratne et al. (7), as was expression and purification of the (+)-pinoresinol-forming PsDRR206 recombinant DP in tomato cell culture.",
        "results": "Detailed biochemical characterization next established it to be a (+)-pinoresinol-forming DP (7), and a homologue to our much earlier discovery of this protein type and its physiological function from Forsythia species (3). Thus we have now discovered DPs producing both pinoresinol antipodes, with the recent discovery of a (−)-pinoresinol-forming DP in Arabidopsis (AtDIR6) (1, 5).",
        "discussion": "The study herein obtained the (+)-pinoresinol-forming DP (PsDRR206) in crystalline form, and at 1.95 Å resolution. In this regard, determination of the PsDRR206 three-dimensional structure, and its analysis suggests that the corresponding trimer has three identical substrate binding sites that are spatially distributed so that intermolecular coupling apparently cannot occur between two distinct substrate binding sites in the trimer model."

      "abstract": "Aims: Redox homeostasis is critical in regulating the fate and function of multipotent cells in the central nervous system (CNS). Here, we investigated whether low dose charged particle irradiation could elicit oxidative stress in neural stem and precursor cells and whether radiation-induced changes in redox metabolism would coincide with cognitive impairment. Results: Low doses (<1 Gy) of charged particles caused an acute and persistent oxidative stress. Early after (<1 week) irradiation, increased levels of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species were generally dose responsive, but were less dependent on dose weeks to months thereafter. Exposure to ion fluences resulting in less than one ion traversal per cell was sufficient to elicit radiation-induced oxidative stress. Whole body irradiation triggered a compensatory response in the rodent brain that led to a significant increase in antioxidant capacity 2 weeks following exposure, before returning to background levels at week 4. Low dose irradiation was also found to significantly impair novel object recognition in mice 2 and 12 weeks following irradiation. Innovation: Data provide evidence that acute exposure of neural stem cells and the CNS to very low doses and fluences of charged particles can elicit a persisting oxidative stress lasting weeks to months that is associated with impaired cognition. Conclusions: Exposure to low doses of charged particles causes a persistent oxidative stress and cognitive impairment over protracted times. Data suggest that astronauts subjected to space radiation may develop a heightened risk for mission critical performance decrements in space, along with a risk of developing long-term neurocognitive sequelae.",
      "sections": {
        "introduction": "Travel to space necessitates exposure to radiation fields containing a spectrum of charged particles having different fluences and energies (15). These fully ionized particles range from protons to iron ions and are derived from solar emissions including periodic flares (mainly protons) along with the galactic cosmic rays (High Z and Energy [HZE] particles). Exposure to such radiation poses a risk that will be proportional to the frequency of particle traversals and the radiation quality (i.e., linear energy transfer [LET]) of that particle (6, 20), although for many central nervous system (CNS) endpoints this relationship is overly simplistic. While energetic protons have relatively low LET, HZE particles typically found in space have much larger LET values that depend on the mass and energy of the ion. These highly energetic (MeV-GeV/n) particles can cause significant cellular damage by direct traversal through tissues of the body and via secondary ionizations caused by delta rays emanating from the track core (14, 41).",
        "methods": "Primary neural stem/precursor cells isolated from the mouse subventricular and hippocampal dentate subgranular zones were used for all studies. These cells were grown in DME/F12 (1:1; Invitrogen), supplemented with bovine serum albumin (0.4%; Sigma), insulin (20 μg/ml; Sigma), progesterone (1.59 nM; Sigma), putrescine (7.7 μg/ml; Sigma), sodium selenite (24 nM; Sigma), apo-transferrin (80 μg/ml; Sigma), heparin (0.76 units/ml; Sigma), epidermal growth factor (200 ng/ml; Biomedical Technologies), and fibroblast growth factor (40 ng/ml; Peprotech). Cultures are passaged three times weekly by mechanical trituration and maintained in T25 flasks kept on an orbital shaker at slow rotation (∼50 rpm) in a CO2 (5%) incubator at 37°C and maximum humidity. Over the course of these experiments, cultures were maintained between passages 10–15 before irradiation and then passaged as described until the time of analysis. Under these conditions, cells routinely exhibit doubling times of 20–22 h.",
        "results": "Neurosphere cultures maintained over time contain mixtures of precursor cells derived from much smaller proportions of stem cells. Cell counts made from irradiated cultures measure the proliferative potential of the surviving precursor cell population that predominate the bulk culture. Irradiation of neurosphere cultures reduces the number of cells in a dose-responsive manner, with a D37 of 1.8 Gy in the low dose range (≤2 Gy, Fig. 1, solid line). At higher doses bulk cell counts were less responsive to dose. Sphere formation was surprisingly resistant to charged particle irradiation, as the formation of spheres showed little dependence on the incident dose (Fig. 1, dashed line). While these assays measure different endpoints, data does suggest that neurosphere cultures contain populations of cells with different sensitivities to charged particle irradiation, likely due to the presence of partially committed stem cell progeny at various states of differentiation.",
        "discussion": "Few studies have investigated the effects of charged particles on neural stem and precursor cells exposed to the low ion fluences expected on a space mission outside the earth's magnetosphere (21, 32). Past work from our lab has characterized the radiation response of multipotent neural cells grown as monolayers to high and low LET radiation, and has shown that following irradiation these cells exhibit a marked rise in acute and persistent oxidative stress that is associated with increased apoptosis, an inhibition of cell cycle progression, and marked radiosensitivity (25, 32, 33). Our present study extends past findings by analyzing multipotent neural cells grown as neurospheres that were exposed to varying doses of charged particles. Present studies also placed an emphasis on very low fluences of HZE particles more typical of the actual space radiation environment, and on analysis of cells over protracted postirradiation times to gauge the long-term consequences of charged particle exposure on astronauts."

      "abstract": "Space missions necessitate physiological and psychological adaptations to environmental factors not present on Earth, some of which present significant risks for the central nervous system (CNS) of crewmembers. One CNS region of interest is the adult olfactory bulb (OB), as OB structure and function are sensitive to environmental- and experience-induced regulation. It is currently unknown how the OB is altered by spaceflight. In this study, we evaluated OB volume and neurogenesis in mice shortly after a 13-day flight on Space Shuttle Atlantis [Space Transport System (STS)-135] relative to two groups of control mice maintained on Earth. Mice housed on Earth in animal enclosure modules that mimicked the conditions onboard STS-135 (AEM-Ground mice) had greater OB volume relative to mice maintained in standard housing on Earth (Vivarium mice), particularly in the granule (GCL) and glomerular (GL) cell layers. AEM-Ground mice also had more OB neuroblasts and fewer apoptotic cells relative to Vivarium mice. However, the AEM-induced increase in OB volume and neurogenesis was not seen in STS-135 mice (AEM-Flight mice), suggesting that spaceflight may have negated the positive effects of the AEM. In fact, when OB volume of AEM-Flight mice was considered, there was a greater density of apoptotic cells relative to AEM-Ground mice. Our findings suggest that factors present during spaceflight have opposing effects on OB size and neurogenesis, and provide insight into potential strategies to preserve OB structure and function during future space missions.",

        "methods": "Female C57BL/6 mice (9 wk of age; Charles River, Wilmington, MA) were shipped directly to NASA Space Life Sciences Laboratory (SLSL) at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on June 21, 2011, where they were housed in identical conditions and allowed to acclimate for >4 wk prior to the start of experimental activities. During this time, mice were weighed ∼3 times/wk and divided into three groups: Vivarium, AEM-Ground, and AEM-Flight. All Vivarium, AEM-Ground, and AEM-Flight mice were chosen from the same shipment of mice with matched birthdates and body weights. AEM-Flight mice flew onboard the STS-135 in animal enclosure modules (AEMs) located on the shuttle's middeck lockers (lockers MF43K, MF57M, and MF57H) for 13 days (July 8, 2011 to July 20, 2011).",
        "results": "As previously reported, body mass of AEM-Ground and AEM-Flight mice was significantly lower at the completion of the STS-135 mission, with AEM-Ground mice weighing slightly more than AEM-Flight mice postflight (96). Total water intake of AEM-Ground mice was greater than AEM-Flight mice (mean ± SE: AEM-Ground 433.3 ± 16.67 ml; AEM-Flight 350.0 ± 0.0 ml; P < 0.001); and water intake per day has also been reported to differ in this same experiment (31).",
        "discussion": "Spaceflight is known to influence numerous aspects of mammalian physiology, including CNS structure and function (17, 19, 65, 84, 96). On Earth, many environmental factors shape OB size and neurogenesis, contributing to olfactory recognition and discrimination (45, 57, 93). Our hypothesis was that exposure to the cumulative factors experienced during spaceflight would have a detrimental effect on OB volume and neurogenesis. Interestingly, our findings here suggest that any negative influence of spaceflight on OB volume and neurogenesis may be prevented or mitigated by exposure to a novel sensory environment, as provided by AEMs."

        "introduction": "Exposure to high doses of ionizing radiation may cause cardiac toxicity that involves pericarditis, fibrosis, conduction abnormalities, coronary heart disease and atherosclerosis [1,2]. While an increased risk of cardiovascular disease has long been shown in radiotherapy patients [3–5], adverse cardiovascular effects, such as ischemic heart disease, have also been described following exposure to doses much lower than in radiation therapy, often decades after radiation exposure [6–8]. Astronauts traveling beyond low earth orbit (LEO), as in a mission to Mars or a near earth asteroid, will be continuously exposed to low dose-rate ionizing radiation, including γ-rays released as secondary radiation resultant from particle radiation interacting with the spacecraft or other shielding material [9]. Hence, there is a concern about potential degenerative tissue effects in the heart with the exposure to ionizing radiation that occurs during space travel.",

      "abstract": "Extended spaceflight has been shown to adversely affect astronaut visual acuity. The purpose of this study was to determine whether spaceflight alters gene expression profiles and induces oxidative damage in the retina. Ten week old adult C57BL/6 male mice were flown aboard the ISS for 35 days and returned to Earth alive. Ground control mice were maintained on Earth under identical environmental conditions. Within 38 (+/−4) hours after splashdown, mice ocular tissues were collected for analysis. RNA sequencing detected 600 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in murine spaceflight retinas, which were enriched for genes related to visual perception, the phototransduction pathway, and numerous retina and photoreceptor phenotype categories.",
      "sections": {
        "introduction": "We are entering an era of renewed interest in space exploration. Although officially the space race ended decades ago, humanity is crossing the threshold into a second space age that includes new global partnerships and private companies. This new infrastructure and organization has brought the concept of long duration space missions, such as permanent moon settlements and manned missions to Mars, from a distant goal to a tangible reality1. However, the space environment is fundamentally different from Earth. Microgravity and ionizing radiation compose a unique set of physiological stressors, the effects of which remain to be fully characterized2,3.",
        "methods": "SpaceX successfully launched the 12th Commercial Resupply Service (CRS-12) payload at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on a 35-day mission in August, 2017. 10-week-old male C57BL/6 mice (n = 20) (Jackson laboratories, Inc. Bar harbor, ME) were flown for NASA’s ninth Rodent Research experiment (RR-9). The mice lived in NASA’s Rodent Habitats (RH) aboard ISS for 35 days before returning to Earth via SpaceX’s Dragon capsule.",
        "results": "The space environment caused a wide array of changes in gene expression, the most prominent were changes in ocular pathways and RNA processing. Twenty mice spent 35 days on the International Space Station as part of NASA’s ninth Rodent Research experiment (RR-9). An additional twenty mice were housed on Earth in the same housing hardware used in flight for the ground control group. RNA sequencing was performed on sixteen mice (n = 8/group). 600 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between the spaceflight and ground control groups using DESeq211 with an adjusted p-value threshold of 0.01 (Sup. Table 1).",
        "discussion": "We have found a distinct gene expression signature in the retina of mice exposed to the spaceflight environment compared with the ground control. This signature is enriched for genes related to visual perception, the phototransduction pathway, and numerous retina and photoreceptor phenotype categories."

      "abstract": "It has been proposed that neuroinflammatory response plays an important role in the neurovascular remodeling in the brain after stress. The goal of the present study was to characterize changes in the gene expression profiles associated with neuroinflammation, neuronal function, metabolism and stress in mouse brain tissue. Ten-week old male C57BL/6 mice were launched to the International Space Station (ISS) on SpaceX-12 for a 35-day mission. Within 38 ± 4 h of splashdown, mice were returned to Earth alive. Brain tissues were collected for analysis. A novel digital color-coded barcode counting technology (NanoStringTM) was used to evaluate gene expression profiles in the spaceflight mouse brain. A set of 54 differently expressed genes (p < 0.05) significantly segregates the habitat ground control (GC) group from the flight (FLT) group. Many pathways associated with cellular stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and metabolism were significantly altered by flight conditions. A decrease in the expression of genes important for oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin sheath maintenance was observed. Moreover, mRNA expression of many genes related to anti-viral signaling, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and bacterial immune response were significantly downregulated. Here we report that significantly altered immune reactions may be closely associated with spaceflight-induced stress responses and have an impact on the neuronal function.",
      "sections": {
        "introduction": "The spaceflight environment is characterized mainly by ultraviolet and ionizing radiation, microgravity, and physiological/psychological stressors. These conditions present a significant hazard to spaceflight crews during the course of mission activities. The susceptibility of the central nervous system (CNS) to spaceflight-induced changes can be particularly devastating to the health, mission performance, and quality of life of the spaceflight crew both acutely and chronically.",
        "methods": "Ten-weeks-old male C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Laboratories, Inc. Bar Harbor, ME) at the time of launch, were flown for NASA’s ninth Rodent Research experiment (RR-9) on SpaceX-12 for a 35-day mission and lived in NASA’s Rodent Habitats aboard the International Space Station.",
        "results": "A set of 54 differently expressed genes (DEG) significantly (p < 0.05) by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey’s HSD (honestly significant difference) test segregates the ground control (GC) group from the flight (FLT) group (Table 1).",
        "discussion": "Our data showed robust changes in gene expression profiles after spaceflight. Genes supporting neuronal synaptic signaling and migration were significantly downregulated. Decreased expression of genes important for oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin sheath maintenance was observed."

      "abstract": "Human space exploration poses inherent risks to astronauts’ health, leading to molecular changes that can significantly impact their well-being. These alterations encompass genomic instability, mitochondrial dysfunction, increased inflammation, homeostatic dysregulation, and various epigenomic changes. Remarkably, these changes bear similarities to those observed during the aging process on Earth. However, our understanding of the connection between these molecular shifts and disease development in space remains limited. Frailty syndrome, a clinical syndrome associated with biological aging, has not been comprehensively investigated during spaceflight. To bridge this knowledge gap, we leveraged murine data obtained from NASA’s GeneLab, along with astronaut data gathered from the JAXA and Inspiration4 missions. Our objective was to assess the presence of biological markers and pathways related to frailty, aging, and sarcopenia within the spaceflight context. Through our analysis, we identified notable changes in gene expression patterns that may be indicative of the development of a frailty-like condition during space missions. These findings suggest that the parallels between spaceflight and the aging process may extend to encompass frailty as well. Consequently, further investigations exploring the utility of a frailty index in monitoring astronaut health appear to be warranted.",
      "sections": {
        "introduction": "Missions beyond low Earth orbit are the new frontier of crewed space exploration. Future missions to Mars as well as long-duration missions to the Moon will be significantly more sustained than any previous deep space mission. During transit, the space environment presents key challenges for astronauts’ safety1. Previous literature describes microgravity, radiation exposure, isolation and confinement as major stressors that are able to induce pathophysiological changes in the heart, skeletal muscle, and immune system, as well as bone loss, central nervous system alterations, and increased cancer risk2–4. Thus, there is increasing interest to identify the molecular mechanisms driving those health risks, including changes in mitochondrial function, genetic and epigenetic regulation, telomere-length dynamics, DNA damage, and oxidative stress3,5 (Fig. 1). Interestingly, the molecular mechanisms of spaceflight-related stressors share similarities with the hallmarks of aging: mitochondrial dysfunction, genomic instability, epigenetic alterations, and telomere length changes (including brief elongation in flight and increased shorter telomeres post-flight), cellular senescence, and dysbiosis, among others6. As a defined set of aging-related molecular changes, the hallmarks of aging may be specifically studied to assess spaceflight impact on human physiology, which could induce a condition similar to premature or pathological aging3.",
        "methods": "All human studies were done with ethical approvals with established and approved IRBs at Weill Cornell Medicine. Blood samples were provided by SpaceX Inspiration4 crew members after consent for research use. The procedure followed guidelines set by Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and operated under Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved protocols and informed consent was obtained. Experiments were conducted in accordance with local regulations and with the approval of the IRB at the Weill Cornell Medicine (IRB #21-05023569). All murine data were obtained from NASA Open Science Data Repository (former GeneLab), where they were previously collected and shared by other investigators. No live animals were used in this investigation. The Open Science Data (OSD) we analyzed are: OSD-21, OSD-52, OSD-99, OSD-101, OSD-103, OSD-104, OSD-105 and OSD-195. Information regarding the chosen datasets is provided in Table 1.",
        "results": "To determine the impact of frailty during spaceflight, we constructed, based on previous literature19–22, a list of putative frailty biomarker genes for humans and mice (Supplementary Data 1). Mouse (OSD-21, 99, 101, 103, 104, 105) datasets from OSDR were analyzed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in flight versus control condition with a statistical cut-off of adjusted p-value < 0.5. In mice, altered expression of frailty-related genes in the following tissues were identified: gastrocnemius (34 genes in OSD-21 and 8 genes in OSD-101); extensor digitorum longus (EDL) (45 genes in OSD-99); quadriceps (26 genes in OSD-101); soleus (36 genes in OSD-104); tibialis anterior (32 genes in OSD-105) (Fig. 2A). A maximum number of four frailty-related genes was also found to be unique to each tissue type and a maximum number of 4 was common between the different datasets (Supplementary Data 2). Hierarchical clustering of the overlapping gene expression across muscle types revealed a bias towards the up-regulation of frailty-related genes (Fig. 2B). As an example, the extensor digitorum longus had several upregulated genes (EGLN3, PTGS2, VDR, FREM2, KRT18, BCL2L1, LGALS3, CXCL10, CX3CL1, FNDC5, TGFB1, CAN, and PPARGC1A). Whereas the soleus (OSD-104) had relatively few downregulated genes (GDF15, PTGS2, BDNF, PAX5, CX3CL1, FNDC5, VCAN, CALU, and SESN2).",
        "discussion": "To our knowledge, no prior links to frailty-like signatures have been observed in the context of spaceflight, and these markers represent an important direction for future research, especially as mission durations increase to years. In recent years, human space research has benefitted from collecting and integrating diverse types of biological data, such as genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, and storing them in biobanks for future analysis19,50. These multi-omics data and biobanks continue to provide valuable insights into the aging-like processes in astronauts during long-term space missions and help identify potential biomarkers and interventions to counteract them25,51–53."

      "abstract": "Spaceflight can change metabolic, immunological, and biological homeostasis and cause skin rashes and irritation, yet the molecular basis remains unclear. To investigate the impact of short-duration spaceflight on the skin, we conducted skin biopsies on the Inspiration4 crew members before (L-44) and after (R + 1) flight. Leveraging multi-omics assays including GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler, single-cell RNA/ATAC-seq, and metagenomics/metatranscriptomics, we assessed spatial gene expressions and associated microbial and immune changes across 95 skin regions in four compartments: outer epidermis, inner epidermis, outer dermis, and vasculature. Post-flight samples showed significant up-regulation of genes related to inflammation and KRAS signaling across all skin regions. These spaceflight-associated changes mapped to specific cellular responses, including altered interferon responses, DNA damage, epithelial barrier disruptions, T-cell migration, and hindered regeneration were located primarily in outer tissue compartments. We also linked epithelial disruption to microbial shifts in skin swab and immune cell activity to PBMC single-cell data from the same crew and timepoints. Our findings present the inaugural collection and examination of astronaut skin, offering insights for future space missions and response countermeasures.",

        "introduction": "During both short- and long-duration spaceflight, the human body is exposed to various factors that are unique to the space environment, including weightlessness (e.g., microgravity), increased radiation, isolation, and confinement1,2. Due to the unique remote and spaceflight environment, lifestyle and hygienic practices are different from an Earth setting and often simplified due to the minimal resources and space available in a spacecraft (e.g., lack of showers, restrooms, limited clothing available)3. Moreover, significant physiological adaptations and overall shifts in biological homeostasis occur from spaceflight exposure, including musculoskeletal deconditioning, cardiovascular fluid shifts, vision loss (e.g., spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome), metabolic shifts, and mitochondrial and immune dysfunction4,5. Several studies have identified the effects of spaceflight on the musculoskeletal and cardiovascular systems, including fluid redistribution, orthostatic intolerance, changes in heart rate, blood pressure, cardiac output, arterial stiffening, bone loss, atrophy of the striated and cardiac muscle groups, and increased risk of bone fracture1,6–12.",
        "methods": "The research in this manuscript complies with all relevant ethical regulations. Tissue samples were provided by SpaceX Inspiration4 crew members (n = 4, two males and two females) after consent for research use of the biopsies, swabs, and biological materials. The procedure followed guidelines set by Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and operated under Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved protocols. Experiments were conducted in accordance with local regulations and with the approval of the IRB at the Weill Cornell Medicine (IRB #21-05023569).",
        "results": "To understand the impact of spaceflight to skin and tissue microenvironment, paired 4 mm skin punch biopsies from Inspiration4 crew members’ upper arms were used for pathology evaluation and spatial transcriptomics profiling (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1). In total, 95 ROIs were collected across 16 slides for processing, with the GeoMx whole transcriptome profiling probe set (18,422 probes). Based on imaging we selected four region types of interest, including the outer epidermis, inner epidermis, outer dermis, and the vasculature (OE, IE, OD, and VA).",
        "discussion": "In this study, we applied a battery of omics methods of the Inspiration4 crew to discern the impact of spaceflight on the skin, collecting and integrating skin spatial transcriptomics data with clinical, metagenomic, metatranscriptomic, and single-cell sequencing data. By performing spatially resolved sequencing of astronaut skin biopsies before and after short-term spaceflight, we see varying transcriptomic and cellular changes and responses specific with their four skin layers (outer and inner epidermis, dermis, and vasculature) across 95 ROIs from all four crew members."

      "abstract": "Maintenance of astronaut health during spaceflight will require monitoring and potentially modulating their microbiomes. However, documenting microbial shifts during spaceflight has been difficult due to mission constraints that lead to limited sampling and profiling. Here we executed a six-month longitudinal study to quantify the high-resolution human microbiome response to three days in orbit for four individuals. Using paired metagenomics and metatranscriptomics alongside single-nuclei immune cell profiling, we characterized time-dependent, multikingdom microbiome changes across 750 samples and 10 body sites before, during and after spaceflight at eight timepoints.",

        "methods": "This study was completely in accordance with appropriate ethics guidelines. All participants consented at an informed consent briefing at SpaceX (Hawthorne, California), and samples were collected and processed under the approval of the institutional review board at Weill Cornell Medicine, under Protocol 21-05023569.",
        "results": "The i4 crew collected a microbiome dataset spanning eight timepoints: three before flight, three after flight and two during flight. In total, we sequenced 385 metagenomic and 365 metatranscriptomic swabs comprising ten body sites representing the oral, nasal and skin microbiomes (n = 750 samples, Fig. 1a), plus eight stool samples (from two participants before and after flight).",
        "discussion": "In this study, which comprises the largest dataset of spaceflight-associated microbiome data so far, we systematically queried the microbiome architecture of short-term spaceflight. Previous efforts, such as the NASA twins study, have had difficulty mapping microbiome shifts due to small sample sizes, restricted body site sampling (n = 3) and limited sequencing modalities25."

      "abstract": "Spaceflight induces molecular, cellular and physiological shifts in astronauts and poses myriad biomedical challenges to the human body, which are becoming increasingly relevant as more humans venture into space1–6. Yet current frameworks for aerospace medicine are nascent and lag far behind advancements in precision medicine on Earth, underscoring the need for rapid development of space medicine databases, tools and protocols. Here we present the Space Omics and Medical Atlas (SOMA), an integrated data and sample repository for clinical, cellular and multi-omic research profiles from a diverse range of missions, including the NASA Twins Study7, JAXA CFE study8,9, SpaceX Inspiration4 crew10–12, Axiom and Polaris. The SOMA resource represents a more than tenfold increase in publicly available human space omics data, with matched samples available from the Cornell Aerospace Medicine Biobank. The Atlas includes extensive molecular and physiological profiles encompassing genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and microbiome datasets, which reveal some consistent features across missions, including cytokine shifts, telomere elongation and gene expression changes, as well as mission-specific molecular responses and links to orthologous, tissue-specific mouse datasets. Leveraging the datasets, tools and resources in SOMA can help to accelerate precision aerospace medicine, bringing needed health monitoring, risk mitigation and countermeasure data for upcoming lunar, Mars and exploration-class missions.",

        "discussion": "Overall, these data represent a comprehensive clinical and multi-omic resource from commercial and non-commercial astronaut cohorts, creating, to our knowledge, the first-ever aerospace medicine biobank, while providing a platform for private citizens to contribute to future astronaut biomedical studies. In addition, we have demonstrated that short-duration, high-elevation (585 km) spaceflight results in broad-ranging molecular changes, in which some of these changes mirror what has been observed during longer-duration spaceflight, including elevated cytokines, telomere elongation and gene expression changes for immune activation, DNA damage response and oxidative stress. Although more than 95% of markers return to baseline in the months after the mission had ended, some proteins, genes and cytokines appear to be activated only in the recovery period after spaceflight and persist post-flight for at least 3 months."

        "introduction": "Throughout the course of a spaceflight mission, the astronaut exposome includes altered gravity, elevated radiation, and confinement within a closed environment with unique hygiene procedures, light cycles, and ventilation1. These stressors perturb biological systems, inducing gene regulatory changes, mitochondrial dysregulation, microbiome shifts, and DNA damage1. Dermatological issues are not typically regarded as a key risk to astronaut health and mission success, yet they are amongst the most common in-flight health issues reported by astronauts.",

        "results": "To explore whether transcriptomic changes in the skin would occur during spaceflight, we analyzed five RNA-Seq datasets from the NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR)40, all representing skin tissue from space flown mice and matching ground control replicates.",
        "discussion": "Skin is well-established as an essential organ for health on Earth, yet despite the frequency of dermatological issues in astronauts2, the molecular response of skin to spaceflight is understudied."

      "abstract": "Organismal adaptations to spaceflight have been characterized at the molecular level in model organisms, including Drosophila and C. elegans. Here, we extend molecular work to energy metabolism and sex hormone signaling in mice and humans. We found spaceflight induced changes in insulin and estrogen signaling in rodents and humans. Murine changes were most prominent in the liver, where we observed inhibition of insulin and estrogen receptor signaling with concomitant hepatic insulin resistance and steatosis. Based on the metabolic demand, metabolic pathways mediated by insulin and estrogen vary among muscles, specifically between the soleus and extensor digitorum longus. In humans, spaceflight induced changes in insulin and estrogen related genes and pathways. Pathway analysis demonstrated spaceflight induced changes in insulin resistance, estrogen signaling, stress response, and viral infection. These data strongly suggest the need for further research on the metabolic and reproductive endocrinologic effects of space travel, if we are to become a successful interplanetary species.",

        "introduction": "We have entered an era in which living and working in space is a reality. Studies show that spaceflight has health risks such as central nervous system and cardiovascular dysfunction, cancer risk, immune dysregulation, muscle and bone loss, and fatty liver1. At the molecular level, risks include oxidative stress, DNA damage, cosmic radiation exposure, mitochondrial dysfunction, microbiome shift, and epigenetic alterations1. Of these, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress have been identified as major space-related risks2. Mitochondria are not only the powerhouse of the cell but also the center of many metabolic pathways. Insulin is a highly conserved anabolic and mitogenic peptide hormone that acts as a master regulator of energy metabolism across species, including humans3. It is secreted by the pancreas in response to increased plasma glucose, and exerts its effects on most organs including the kidney and liver as well as skeletal muscle, and bone4. Insulin receptor is a transmembrane receptor belonging to the family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs)5 and undergoes autophosphorylation upon activation, leading to a downstream signaling cascade which influences cellular function, particularly glucose metabolism. Insulin resistance (IR) arises when these downstream molecular pathways do not respond appropriately in target tissues, thus impeding the physiologic response to insulin. In the physiological state, IR can also be observed due to opposing actions from counterregulatory hormones such as glucagon, glucocorticoids, and catecholamines. Insulin resistance is further associated with metabolic abnormalities such as diabetes, lipid dysfunction, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), cardiovascular disease, retinopathy, and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Each of these factors is also interconnected, thus resulting in a potentially vicious cycle.",
        "methods": "All omics data related to mouse samples were obtained from NASA’s GeneLab public omics repository86. The data derived from spaceflight experiments carried out onboard the ISS as part of the Rodent Research-1 (RR-1), RR-5, RR-7, and MHU-2 missions. A description of the experimental design, the corresponding type of tissues, and the data accessed are summarized in Supplementary Table 1. All previous animal experiments and methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines at each principal investigators’ institutions and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use committee (IACUC). A detailed description of the methodology for obtaining tissue samples and processing is available in NASA’s GeneLab platform.",
        "results": "To understand how insulin and estrogen signaling change during spaceflight we examined gene expression in mice that were flown to the International Space Station (ISS) for 37 days. For this purpose, adrenal glands (OSD-98), kidney (OSD-102), liver (OSD-168), eyes (OSD-100), and skeletal muscles (i.e. quadriceps (OSD-103), gastrocnemius (OSD-101), soleus (OSD-104), tibialis anterior (OSD-105), and extensor digitorum longus (OSD-99)) were utilized (Fig. 1a). The transcriptomic data (RNA-seq) was obtained for 16-week-old female mice from the NASA GeneLab platform28 and were analyzed for insulin signaling, estrogen signaling and insulin resistance related genes and pathways. The gene lists for these hormones were obtained from the NCBI resource29 (i.e. ‘insulin signaling’ mus musculus). The greatest number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were observed in the mouse liver (n = 3670), followed by soleus (n = 3518) and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) (n = 1859) muscles. In all, 2677 DEGs were unique to the liver, 2048 DEGs were unique to soleus muscle, and 784 DEGs were unique to EDL (Fig. 1b). The least number of DEGs was noted in the adrenal gland (n = 61) and 28 of them were unique to it (Fig. 1b). There are a total of 1970 unique genes from the NCBI curated gene list which are commonly encountered across insulin resistance, insulin signaling and estrogen signaling pathways. Most of the genes from the NCBI list related to insulin resistance, insulin signaling, and estrogen signaling were downregulated in the liver (Fig. 1c). In total, 645 out of the 1970 unique genes from the NCBI resource had gene expression values across all nine tissues. These genes were divided into seven biologically relevant clusters associated with insulin resistance and signaling (Fig. 1d). In particular, the last cluster (cluster 7) at the bottom of the heatmap were related to Gene Ontology (GO) processes30 such as lipid localization and glycerolipid metabolic processes which are relate",
        "discussion": "Consistent with past reports that insulin signaling is a central regulator of gene expression changes and lipid metabolism in response to spaceflight in the worm, C. elegans64,65, we find that gene expression changes related to insulin signaling occur in spaceflown rodents and humans. Further, we find that estrogen signaling gene expression changes also occur in both spaceflown rodents and humans."

      "sections": {
        "introduction": "The terrestrial colonization of plants is a critical milestone in the Earth’s evolution history, dramatically increasing the productivity of organic carbon on land to support highly diverse ecosystems1,2. The emergence of roots with a gravitropic growth pattern is a critical evolution for land plants, enabling them to anchor in the soil and absorb water and nutrients3. Root gravitropism features perception of gravity by the root cap and directional growth regulation mediated by auxin4. In gravity-oriented roots, symmetrical distribution of auxin in root tips maintain symmetrical growth5. When root growth deviates from the direction of gravity, the amyloplasts in the columella cells of the root cap rapidly sink to the plasma membrane at the bottom, triggering the activation of gravity response via LAZY proteins6,7. Such response entails relocation of the auxin exporter PIN-FORMED (PIN) in the cells and redistribution of auxin8–10, thus promoting asymmetric auxin flow and asymmetric cell growth to bend the root tip to the gravity direction11. Mutations in auxin transporters and gravity-signaling-related proteins often lead to defective root gravitropism during vertical growth, such as root tips growing toward random directions7,12,13, wavy roots14, and enlarged root angles15,16.",
        "methods": "The japonica rice cultivar Zhonghua11 was used as the wild type (WT) for all experiments. An ethyl methylsulfonate (EMS)-mutagenized population (M3 generation) was used for root phenotype screening. Transgenic plant materials were generated as described below. Seeds were surface sterilized with 15% NaClO for 30 min, washed with sterilized water, and placed in a 37 °C incubator for 2 days to promote germination. Germinated seeds were transferred to hydroponic boxes, soil culture boxes or agar plates to grow depending on the requirements of different experiments. Experiments were carried out in a growth room with the following conditions: temperature 28 °C ± 0.5 °C, humidity 50%–60%, 12-h photoperiod with a light intensity of 100 mmol of photons m−2 s−1. WT and mutant were also grown in two paddy fields (Nanjing and Sanya) to maturity.",
        "results": "We screened an ethyl methylsulfonate-mutagenized population (approximately 5000 lines) of the rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivar Zhonghua11 and isolated a mutant with root coiling phenotype when grown in hydroponic culture (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Movie 1). Both seminal and adventitious roots of the mutant coiled in the root tip region, resulting in a shorter root depth compared to the wild type (WT, Supplementary Fig. 1). Changes in nutrient supply, solution pH, aeration (dissolved oxygen level), and exposure to light did not alter the root coiling phenotype of the mutant in hydroponic culture (Supplementary Fig. 2). When grown in water-saturated solid media (e.g. paddy soil, soil-vermiculite mixture, vermiculite and peat pellet), however, the root coiling phenotype disappeared (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 3). We named the mutant coiling root in water (crw1).",
        "discussion": "Ethylene plays a critical role in plant growth, development and resistance to multiple biotic and abiotic stresses. Because ethylene biosynthesis fluctuates widely under the influence of changing environments18,51, its effect on gravitropic growth of roots must be tightly regulated. In this study, by dissecting the genetic basis for the root coiling phenotype in the rice mutant crw1, we uncovered the molecular module of OsCRW1 (OsEBF1)-OsEIL1/OsEIL2-OsERF82-ROS that connects ethylene signaling to gravitropism in rice roots (Fig. 8). Furthermore, by addressing why growing in soft solid media rescued root coiling phenotype of crw1, we discovered an unexpected role of root cap mechanosensing in limiting excessive ethylene signaling, thereby safeguarding gravitropic growth of rice roots (Fig. 8)."

      "abstract": "Mounting ambitions and capabilities for public and private, non-government sector crewed space exploration bring with them an increasingly diverse set of space travelers, raising new and nontrivial ethical, legal, and medical policy and practice concerns which are still relatively underexplored. In this piece, we lay out several pressing issues related to ethical considerations for selecting space travelers and conducting human subject research on them, especially in the context of non-governmental and commercial/private space operations.",
      "sections": {
        "introduction": "It has been over 50 years since the first human walked on the Moon. Since then, most commercialized spaceflights have been contracts granted to private companies by various governments to launch satellites, e.g., communication and GPS devices, into Earth’s orbit. In recent years, the definition of commercial spaceflight has expanded to include human transportation between Earth and habitats in Low Earth Orbit and future lunar or other extraterrestrial outposts. Once considered nearly impossible, commercial space travel is now a reality, due to rapid technological advancement in the private sector, large-scale investment from governments, and continued public interest. With the first crewed launch of SpaceX Dragon to the International Space Station (ISS), on May 30, 20201, a new era of public-private spaceflight partnership has emerged. Private companies such as Boeing, Virgin Galactic, Axiom, Sierra Space, and Blue Origin now create a steep commercial demand for crewed spaceflight, both for technological and recreational purposes. NASA has further partnered with Axiom Space for commercial utilization of the ISS until the world’s first commercial space station is built by 20282. There is currently a wide range of private/commercial spaceflights, ranging from suborbital flights lasting mere minutes to Axiom’s 1-2 week ISS missions to the first all-civilian orbital commercial spaceflight mission referred to as ‘Inspiration4’ (I4), comparable in duration (and health risks) to orbital shuttle missions1–3.",

Due to a dearth of nutrients and/or other factors, bacteria in the host often experience this late growth phase (5–8), and it is in this phase that many of their virulence traits are primarily expressed (9–11).",
        "methods": "Bacteria were grown overnight to late stationary phase at 37°C in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth with shaking (200 rpm); the following morning, they were diluted to an A600 of 0.45 (1.3 × 109 cells/ml) in M9 minimal medium without glucose (34, 35) (referred to as M9 salts).",
        "results": "Deletion of the rpoS gene (absence of σs) rendered E. coli (K-12 BW25113) (33) more sensitive to Gm: at 24 h of treatment, mutant survival was more than 2 logs less than that of the wild type (Fig. 1).",

These multiple differences from those experienced on the earth may cause systemic and local tissue stress. Autonomic nerves, including sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves, regulate functions in multiple organs. Saliva is secreted from the salivary gland, which is regulated by autonomic nerves, and plays several important roles in the oral cavity and digestive processes.",
      "sections": {
        "introduction": "The transition from 1 g to the space environment changes not only gravity but also various other conditions such as the circadian rhythm (Otsuka et al., 2018) and exposure to cosmic rays (Zeitlin et al., 2013). It is important to elucidate the medical risks that humans face when living in a space environment, such as the oxidative stress caused by cosmic radiation (Overbey et al., 2019) and mechanical stress caused by microgravity (Dadwal et al., 2019). Artificial imitation of these environments may provide an understanding of gravitational physiology and determine how to avoid space stress.",

      "abstract": "Plant roots navigate in the soil environment following the gravity vector. Cell divisions in the meristem and rapid cell growth in the elongation zone propel the root tips through the soil. Actively elongating cells acidify their apoplast to enable cell wall extension by the activity of plasma membrane AHA H+-ATPases. The phytohormone auxin, central regulator of gravitropic response and root development, inhibits root cell growth, likely by rising the pH of the apoplast. However, the role of auxin in the regulation of the apoplastic pH gradient along the root tip is unclear. Here, we show, by using an improved method for visualization and quantification of root surface pH, that the Arabidopsis thaliana root surface pH shows distinct acidic and alkaline zones, which are not primarily determined by the activity of AHA H+-ATPases. Instead, the distinct domain of alkaline pH in the root transition zone is controlled by a rapid auxin response module, consisting of the AUX1 auxin influx carrier, the AFB1 auxin co-receptor, and the CNCG14 calcium channel. We demonstrate that the rapid auxin response pathway is required for an efficient navigation of the root tip.",
      "sections": {
        "introduction": "Plants colonize soil by the growth of their roots. Because plant cells are non-motile, mechanically coupled by their cell walls and symplastically connected by plasmodesmata, the extent and direction of root growth is driven by the elongation of cells that can differ across the organ (Braidwood et al., 2014). The balance between cell proliferation and differentiation in the root apex is controlled by several phytohormone and peptide signaling pathways, among which auxin plays a specific role, thanks to its long-distance intercellular transport that serves as the information carrier between distant plant tissues (Grieneisen et al., 2007; Wisniewska et al., 2006).",
        "methods": "We used the Col-0 ecotype and the following mutant and transgenic lines. The PIN2>>AHA2delta95, PIN2>>PP2C-D1 originate from this study, see Molecular cloning. Further, we used the aha2-4 (SALK_082786), pp2c-d2/5/6 triple mutant (Ren et al., 2018) (pp2c-d2 WsDsLOX493G12, pp2c-d5GABI_330E08, and pp2c-d6 SAIL_171H03), aux1-100 (SALK_020355), pin2 (NASC_N16706). The afb1-3 and AFB1::AFB1-mCitrine in afb1-3 originate from Prigge et al., 2020. The afb1-1s (SALK_144884C) was genotyped using the following primers SALK_LBb1.3, AACGGAAGACTAGGAAGCGAG, GCAACAGCTTCAAGACCTTTG. The cngc14-1 (SALK_206460) was genotyped by SALK_LBb1.3, CACCTGCTTGTAAAGCAAAGG, TCGGAACAATTGGCAGAATAC; cngc14-2 (wiscDsLox437E09) by WisDsLox_LBP (AACGTCCGCAATGTGTTATTAAGTTGTC), TGTTTCACGTAAAGTCAAACCC, TAAGAATCCAAGTGGCCACAC. The CNGC14::CNGC14-GFP (see Molecular cloning) was transformed into the cngc14-1 and cngc14-2 homozygous lines. The tir triple is the tir1,afb2,3 mutant (Dharmasiri et al., 2005). We used the tmk1-1 (SALK_016360), tmk4-1 (GABI_348E01) (Li et al., 2021), and the abp1-TD1 (SK21825) (Gao et al., 2015). AUX1::AUX1-YFP (Swarup et al., 2004) was introduced into afb1-3 and cngc14-2 by crossing. AUX1::AUX1-YFP was crossed with PIN::PIN2-mCherry (Retzer et al., 2019).",
        "results": "To monitor the spatio-temporal dynamics of root ion fluxes and apoplastic pH in vertically growing roots of A. thaliana, we re-evaluated the available fluorescence staining methods to visualize pH in roots. Cell wall staining by 8-hydroxypyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid trisodium salt (HPTS) (Barbez et al., 2017) was not satisfactory in our setup, due to the very high background signal and probably due to the absence of the optimal 458 nm excitation in our vertical stage spinning disk microscope (Serre et al., 2021). However, at the transition zone of the root, we could observe an alkaline domain on the root surface (Figure 1—figure supplement 1a). Further, we attempted to visualize root surface pH using Fluorescein Dextran and Oregon Green Dextran (Figure 1—figure supplement 1a) pH reporters (Monshausen et al., 2011; Geilfus and Mühling, 2011), but the results were not satisfactory due to an artifact when roots were imaged on solid medium (Figure 1—figure supplement 1d). We therefore searched for alternative pH-sensitive fluorescent dyes, and discovered Fluorescein-5-(and-6)-Sulfonic Acid, Trisodium Salt (FS) (Invitrogen F1130; Seksek et al., 1995; Rosario and Rojas, 1986) as an excellent reporter of root surface pH.",
        "discussion": "In this work, we present a new method to determine the root surface pH of A. thaliana. Its advantage is the sensitivity of FS in lower pH range that enables a spectacular visualization of root surface pH, including the acidic domain surrounding the late elongation and maturation zones of roots, which was not detected with the previously published methods (Monshausen et al., 2011; Shih et al., 2015). FS is an inexpensive dye which can be excited by the common 405 and 488 nm laser lines. In this work, we avoided measuring absolute pH values; instead, we determined the relative pH compared to internal controls observed on the same medium. Absolute pH determination would be possible, if extensive pH calibration was performed during each imaging session. This approach would be very laborious, and, in addition, absolute fluorescence intensities might depend on the thickness of the layer of medium and many other parameters. Therefore, we recommend using FS to determine relative pH changes compared to internal controls, that is WT plants or mock controls imaged together with mutants or treated roots."

      "abstract": "Astronauts are exposed to harsh conditions, including cosmic radiation and microgravity. Spaceflight elongates human telomeres in peripheral blood, which shorten upon return to Earth and approach baseline levels during postflight recovery. Astronauts also encounter muscle atrophy, losing up to 20% loss of muscle mass on spaceflights. Telomere length changes in muscle cells of astronauts remain unexplored. This study investigates telomere alterations in grounded mice experiencing radiation exposure and muscle atrophy, via a hindlimb unloading spaceflight mimicking model. We find telomere lengthening is present in muscle stem cells and in myofiber nuclei, but not in muscle-resident endothelial cells. We further assessed telomere length in the model following hindlimb unloading recovery. We find that telomere length failed to return to baseline values. Our results suggest a role for telomeres in muscle acclimatization, which is relevant for the well-being of astronauts in space, and upon their return to Earth.",

        "introduction": "In the vacuum of space, astronauts are continuously bombarded by high energy cosmic radiation and must perform missions in microgravity1. A better understanding of the consequences of these two factors on body function and physiology are crucial for the planning of safe and successful long-duration future missions. A major detriment experienced by astronauts in flight is muscle atrophy, where a 1 month spaceflight can reduce muscle mass by 20% and muscle strength by 30%2. Even with currently implemented spaceflight countermeasures, involving rigorous exercise, the deleterious physiological effects of spaceflight in muscle atrophy and weakness induction are not completely abrogated3–5. In addition to microgravity, astronaut exposure to cosmic radiation can have effects on body systems that are still being elucidated. It is well established that the skeletal muscle atrophy due to exposure to both microgravity and radiation is problematic because of its rapid onset and severity6.",
        "methods": "Male C57Bl/6 mice were purchased from Jackson Labs (stock# 000664) and used between 2 and 4 months of age. Experimental procedures for this project were approved and overseen by the University of Pennsylvania IACUC committee (protocol #806800). Following receipt, mice were acclimated to University of Pennsylvania rodent housing for 1 week prior to commencing the experiments. All mice in this study were fed Dietgel boost food (ClearH2O) and provided hydrogel barrier hydration (ClearH2O) ad libitum (as the sole nutrition and hydration sources) for the duration of the experiment.",
        "results": "To address the effects of muscle atrophy and/or irradiation (IR) on skeletal muscles, we utilized the widely accepted hindlimb suspension (HLS) ground-based model27, in combination with or in the absence of whole-body ionizing radiation exposure. In our experimental design, mice were divided into four different cohorts: control (without IR exposure, without hindlimb suspension (HLS)), HLS only (no IR), IR only (no HLS), and combined (HLS + IR); (Fig. 1). More specifically, wildtype mice were pre-exposed to 2 Gy whole-body irradiation or sham irradiated and further divided into groups experiencing HLS or not. Following a 3-week time course, mice were sacrificed, and various tissue weight metrics were obtained.",
        "discussion": "Astronauts experience adverse health effects on long-duration missions, including headaches, dizziness, congestion, changes in blood cells, and fatigue, as well as severe bone and muscle loss49. A better understanding of the causes of such impediments to explorer health in an earthbound model could serve beneficial effects in the development of additional countermeasures or prophylactic treatments meant to reduce physical health burdens."

      "abstract": "Guard cell swelling controls the aperture of stomata, pores that facilitate gas exchange and water loss from leaves. The hormone abscisic acid (ABA) has a central role in regulation of stomatal closure through synthesis of second messengers, which include reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS accumulation must be minimized by antioxidants to keep concentrations from reaching damaging levels within the cell. Flavonols are plant metabolites that have been implicated as antioxidants; however, their antioxidant activity in planta has been debated. Flavonols accumulate in guard cells of Arabidopsis thaliana, but not surrounding pavement cells, as visualized with a flavonol-specific dye. The expression of a reporter driven by the promoter of CHALCONE SYNTHASE, a gene encoding a flavonol biosynthetic enzyme, in guard cells, but not pavement cells, suggests guard cell-specific flavonoid synthesis. Increased levels of ROS were detected using a fluorescent ROS sensor in guard cells of transparent testa4-2, which has a null mutation in CHALCONE SYNTHASE and therefore synthesizes no flavonol antioxidants. Guard cells of transparent testa4-2 show more rapid ABA-induced closure than the wild type, suggesting that flavonols may dampen the ABA-dependent ROS burst that drives stomatal closing. The levels of flavonols are positively regulated in guard cells by ethylene treatment in the wild type, but not in the ethylene-insensitive2-5 mutant. In addition, in both ethylene-overproducing1 and ethylene-treated wild-type plants, elevated flavonols lead to decreasing ROS and slower ABA-mediated stomatal closure. These results are consistent with flavonols suppressing ROS accumulation and decreasing the rate of ABA-dependent stomatal closure, with ethylene-induced increases in guard cell flavonols modulating these responses.",

The focus of this review is on the SARS-CoV-2 virus’ mechanism of infection and its proclivity at adapting and restructuring the intracellular environment to support viral replication. We highlight current knowledge and how scientific communities with expertize in viral, cellular, and clinical biology have contributed to increase our understanding of SARS-CoV-2, and how these findings may help explain the widely varied clinical observations of COVID-19 patients.",

        "introduction": "As of November 21st, 2021, over 257 million cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been reported, and more than 5 million lives claimed globally [1]. The disease is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 provide a major step forward in reducing COVID-19’s impact. However, the pandemic is ongoing, and the continued viral transmission allows for accumulation of mutations in the viral genome, which can provide advantages in replication, immune escape, increased transmissibility, or diagnostic detection failure [2]. With the quickly evolving SARS-CoV-2 variants and the slow rate of vaccination globally, it is critical to fully understand this novel virus and disease.",

        "introduction": "Throughout history, humans have explored the earth, so much so, that few regions outside of the ocean depths still remain unexplored. This drive to go “where no man has gone before,” coupled with increasing pollution, climate change, and competition for scarcer resources, has brought humans to the point at which exploration and exploitation of other celestial bodies, such as the moon, asteroids, and other planets, is inevitable. However, our organ systems have evolved to work under 1g, and it is not clear what the effect of long-term exposure to lower gravity environments might be and how those effects are exerted at the cellular and molecular levels.",
        "methods": "",
        "results": "We used vented fly boxes (VFBs) to carry multiple vials of adult Drosophila, each with 10 females and 5 males, to the ISS (see protocol schematic; Figure 1A). Eggs laid on the food in the bottom of the vials hatched into larva that then metamorphosed into adults in about 10–12 days, all under microgravity. VFBs and vials containing live adult flies were returned to earth gravity, and flies were processed within ~2 days of exposure to 1g (space-flown [SF] flies). We also collected flies that emerged from those same vials at 1g (days 3–5 after splash down) and aged them for 2 weeks at 1g before processing (space flight recovery [SFR]).",
        "discussion": "As humans increasingly venture into our interplanetary space, it will be important to understand the different ways in which prolonged exposure to altered g forces affect organ systems that have evolved under 1g. Muscle function is known to be affected by prolonged weightlessness, but most studies address the “bulk” properties of muscle fibers, leaving the cellular and mechanistic causes relatively unexplored."

      "abstract": "Studies of how microorganisms respond to pressure have been limited mostly to the extreme high pressures of the deep sea (i.e., the piezosphere). In contrast, despite the fact that the growth of most bacteria is inhibited at pressures below ∼2.5 kPa, little is known of microbial responses to low pressure (LP). To study the global LP response, we performed transcription microarrays on Bacillus subtilis cells grown under normal atmospheric pressure (∼101 kPa) and a nearly inhibitory LP (5 kPa), equivalent to the pressure found at an altitude of ∼20 km.",
      "sections": {
        "introduction": "On Earth, there are a number of harsh environments that challenge microbial life due to extremes of fundamental physical factors, such as temperature, pressure, pH, or osmolarity. It is thus of prime importance to understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms that enable microbes to grow and, indeed, to flourish at such physical extremes.",
        "methods": "All strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1. Strain WN624 (trpC2 amyE::spc) has been described in detail previously (32, 33). B. subtilis strain PB344, harboring a deletion-insertion mutation inactivating sigB, was obtained from Chet Price (34). B. subtilis strain BSM151, carrying a lacZ fusion to the SigB-dependent, general stress response (GSR)-induced ctc gene, was obtained from Uwe Völker (35).",
        "results": "In order to gain a greater understanding of the global gene expression changes occurring in response to LP, strain WN624 was studied using transcriptional microarrays. Total RNA was extracted from cells after 24 h of growth at either 5 kPa or ∼101 kPa, and RNA labeling and chip analyses were conducted as described in Materials and Methods.",
        "discussion": "Exposure of B. subtilis to LP most notably induced the SigB-mediated general stress response (GSR) (44); transition-state regulons such as AbrB/Abh (45, 46), CodY (47), Rok (48), SigH (49), Spo0A (50), and, to a lesser extent, SigD (51); anaerobic regulons, such as ResD (52) and, to a lesser extent, Fnr (53) and Rex (54); the carbon catabolite repression regulator"

However, the influence of this environment on host–pathogen interactions remains poorly understood. Here we report our results from the STL-IMMUNE study flown aboard Space Shuttle mission STS-131, which investigated multi-omic responses (transcriptomic, proteomic) of human intestinal epithelial cells to infection with Salmonella Typhimurium when both host and pathogen were simultaneously exposed to spaceflight. To our knowledge, this was the first in-flight infection and dual RNA-seq analysis using human cells.",

        "methods": "The human colonic epithelial cell line, HT-29 (ATCC, HTB-38), was cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in GTSF-2 media (Hyclone) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (ThermoFisher Scientific), 2.25 g sodium bicarbonate (Fisher Scientific) and 5 mL insulin transferrin selenite (Sigma-Aldrich) per liter. Media used to expand cells as monolayers contained Penicillin–Streptomycin (10 units/mL and 10 µg/mL, respectively; Sigma-Aldrich) and fungizone (0.5 µg/mL). Flight culture media contained only streptomycin (Sm) and fungizone. Infection studies were performed with wild-type S. Typhimurium χ3339, a mouse-passaged derivative of SL1344 which is naturally Sm-resistant24. Bacteria were cultured in Lennox Broth (LB) containing 0.3 M NaCl prior to loading in the hardware, as described below. HT-29 cells were cultured in 2.2 mL hollow fiber bioreactors (Spectrum Labs) that were housed in the Cell Culture Module (CCM; Tissue Genesis). The CCM hardware enabled automated media perfusion, addition of bacteria to perform infections and sample fixation. Flight comparisons were made to identical ground controls housed in the same hardware at NASA Kennedy Space Center (KSC). The flight hardware and experimental layout are shown in Fig. 1.",

        "introduction": "Opportunities to perform biological studies in space are rare due to high costs and a limited number of funding sources, rocket launches, and spaceflight crew hours for experimental procedures. In addition, spaceflight research is decentralized and distributed across numerous laboratories in the United States and abroad. As a result, studies performed in different laboratories often utilize different organisms, strains, cell lines, and experimental procedures. Adding to this complexity are variance in spaceflight factors and/or confounders within each study, such as degree of radiation exposure, experiment duration, CO2 concentration, light cycle, and water availability, all of which can have effects on an organism's health and gene expression profiles during spaceflight (Rutter et al., 2020). In order to optimize the integration of data from this diverse array of spaceflight experiments, it is paramount that variations in data processing are minimized.",
        "methods": "All methods can be found in the accompanying transparent methods supplemental file.",
        "results": "There are three distinct steps to the RCP, the first of which is data preprocessing (Figure 2A). The pipeline begins with quality control (QC) of raw FASTQ files from a short-read Illumina sequencer using the FastQC software (Andrews, 2010) (Figure 2B). FastQC is one of the most widely used QC programs for short-read sequencing data. It provides information that can be used to assess sample and sequencing quality, including base statistics, per base sequencing quality, per sequence quality scores, per base sequence content, per base GC content, per sequence GC content, per base N content, sequence length distributions, sequence duplication levels, overrepresented sequences, and k-mer content.",
        "discussion": "The differentially expressed genes calculated by the RCP can be further explored with a variety of tools designed for higher-order analysis. For example, there are tools that can look for enriched pathways, gene ontology terms, or protein and/or metabolite networks. Popular software tools among the GeneLab working group members include WebGestalt (Liao et al., 2019), STRING (Szklarczyk et al., 2019), GSEA (Subramanian et al., 2005), PIANO (Väremo et al. 2013), Reactome (Szklarczyk et al., 2019), and ToppFun (Chen et al., 2009). There is no universal consensus on which tools are the most useful for higher-order analysis (Nguyen et al., 2019). RCP users are encouraged to try multiple tools in order to analyze their data from a variety of perspectives."

For some of these risks, countermeasures have been sufficiently developed to sustain human health in low-Earth orbit, the orbital distance from Earth that includes the International Space Station (ISS). However, as humankind plans for a permanent presence on the moon and seeks to advance to Mars, the limits to our countermeasures and the research gaps that have insofar remained unaddressed will create health challenges that rival the engineering challenges of long-duration space missions.",

      "abstract": "During medium- to long-duration spaceflights, real-time microgravity can increase the health risks of astronauts. In particular, the disruption of intestinal homeostasis is closely related to other health problems, and it is necessary to monitor related treatment strategies. Ginseng is a well-known Chinese herbal medicine often used to maintain health. Ginseng total saponins (GTSs), which are the bioactive components of ginseng, have been reported to regulate immune homeostasis, anti-inflammation, and anti-oxidation. This study focused on the regulation of GTSs in intestinal homeostasis imbalance caused by microgravity.",
      "sections": {
        "introduction": "Long-duration spaceflight missions face challenges due to a variety of factors, including high vacuum, intense radiation, and low magnitude of gravity. Microgravity exposure is the main difficulty that needs to be overcome in real time, which causes astronauts to be in sub-health for a long time, affecting flight tasks and physical fitness.1 Several studies have shown that microgravity is closely related to health problems such as immune system disorders, cardiovascular dysfunction, and skeletal muscle loss. Intestinal microecology plays an important role in mediating the decline in these functions.2 Under weightlessness conditions, the intestine directly suffers from structural damage caused by various stress factors, including disruption of intestinal barrier integrity and gut microbiota imbalance.3,4 Moreover, the gut also regulates immune function and affects signal transduction between the host and intestinal microorganisms by producing intestinal microbial metabolites such as SCFAs.5,6 Evidence from animal experiments has reported serious intestinal barrier damage under weightlessness simulation, including typical intestinal villi injury, downregulation of tight junction protein expression, cell apoptosis, and increased intestinal permeability.3 Similarly, shortened intestinal villi, shallower crypt depth, and reduced mucin production in intestinal epithelial cells were observed in spaceflight rats.7,8 Recent data also show that the fluctuation of intestinal flora caused by weightlessness will lead to the imbalance of the immune system and increase the risk of opportunistic infection. A study revealed that weightlessness caused change in the ratio of Bacteroides to Firmicutes, which may lead to the production of inflammatory cytokines by activating pattern recognition receptors8. In addition, microbiota metabolites also participate in the pathological changes of the digestive system related to spaceflight stress and play a role in the body signal transduction.",
        "methods": "The GTSs, prepared according to previously published methods,19 were provided by the Institute of Medicinal Plants, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. Ginsenosides Rb1 (Cat no. RM0502), Rb2 (Cat no. RM0503), Rg1 (Cat no. RM0509), Rg2 (Cat no. RM0510), Rc (Cat no. RM0505), Rd (Cat no. RM0506), Re (Cat no. RM0507), and Rf (Cat no. RM0508) were obtained from RefMedic (Sichuan, China). TNF-α (Cat no. 1317202) and IL-6 (Cat no. 1310602) ELISA kits were bought from Dakewei Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Shenzhen, China).",
        "results": "The MRM chromatograms of ginsenosides Rb1, Rb2, Rg1, Rg2, Rc, Rd, Re, and Rf from GTSs were optimized for quantitative analysis. The calibration curve of the eight compounds showed good linearity with the available standards (R2 > 0.99), and the lower limits of quantification for the ginsenosides ranged from 2.4414 to 312.5 ng/mL, indicating sufficient sensitivity for quantitative evaluation. As a result, It contained 258.89 mg/g Rb1, 65.77 mg/g Rb2, 12.87 mg/gRg1, 26.14 mg/g Rg2, 93.72 mg/g Rc, 90.90 mg/g Rd, 105.34 mg/g Re and 20.87 mg/g Rf (Figure S1).",
        "discussion": "Long-term microgravity exposure causes adverse effects on the immune system. The innate immune system, which is composed of granulocytes, natural killer cells, monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells, is the first line of defense for the body to initiate self-protection.22 It can not only recognize invading pathogens, but also sense and interact with the environment.23 Previous reports have suggested that more than 50% of astronauts on the first manned missions showed increased susceptibility to microbial infections caused by impaired innate immune systems.24 In addition, recent studies have further demonstrated that microgravity can impair the differentiation, function and signal transduction of innate immune cells.23 For example, the analysis of peripheral blood from astronauts showed that space flight would lead to impaired cell migration and antigen presentation mediated by monocytes in innate immunity.22 The intestinal innate immune system encompasses barrier defenses serviced by the epithelial cell layer, as well as bactericidal immune cell populations, including macrophages and neutrophils.25 Breakdowns in intestinal homeostasis driven by weightlessness are related to immune system perturbations.7 Intestinal immune cells are distributed in the intestinal epithelium, lamina propria, and lymphoid tissue.26 Mesenteric lymph nodes (MLD), which are located in lymphoid tissues, are sites of intestinal adaptive immune responses induced by intestinal microbiomes and mediate inflammatory responses.27 CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are also important contributors. In this study, GTSs significantly increased the proportion of CD3+CD4+ T cells in MLD and improved the CD4+ /CD8+ ratio, suggesting that GTSs could enhance the cell-mediated immune response of MLD and the intestinal immune barrier. In addition, transcriptomic analysis identified innate immune pathways significantly associated with HLS and confirmed the downregulation of immune-related genes (Ly6e, Isg15 and Ifi27l2"

This phenomenon, called gravitropism, is influenced by most of the major plant hormones including brassinosteroids. Epi-brassinolide (eBL) was previously shown to enhance root gravitropism, a phenomenon similar to the response of roots exposed to the actin inhibitor, latrunculin B (LatB). This led us to hypothesize that eBL might enhance root gravitropism through its effects on filamentous-actin (F-actin).",

Furthermore, the weight imposed by gravity on each organ results in a mechanical load that must be counteracted by thick, sturdy cell walls and specialized morphologies.",
        "methods": "Experiments aimed at investigating the effects of microgravity environments on plant growth, development, and gene expression relative to ground controls should be conducted such that germination and growth occur under microgravity for the treated plants, avoiding any post-germination exposure to the 1-g conditions of Earth and/or hypergravity and vibration conditions typically experienced during takeoff and flight back to Earth.",
        "results": "In a first attempt to evaluate the effect of the microgravity environment of ISS on Brachypodium seedlings, we investigated the direction of root and shoot growth after five days of cultivation on ISS and a ground control at KSC, and quantified shoot and root growth from pictures taken at the end of the growth period under both conditions.",

        "introduction": "Exploration missions to the Moon and Mars would expose astronauts to environmental challenges, including gravitational changes, ionizing radiation, altered circadian rhythm, elevated CO2, and isolation. Human acclimation to these environments presents complex health effects, with acute and prolonged consequences in multiple tissues that may result in increased risk to crew health and performance during the mission (Afshinnekoo et al., 2020; Crucian et al., 2015; Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019; Grimm et al., 2016; Indo et al., 2016; Kononikhin et al., 2017; Wilson et al., 2018). With a high concentration of oxidizable, unsaturated lipids, low levels of antioxidant defenses, and high energy demand, the central nervous system (CNS) is particularly vulnerable to space stressors, with studies reporting behavioral deficits in spatial orientation, coordination, and locomotion, as well as cognition (Cekanaviciute et al., 2018; Clément et al., 2020, Salim, 2017, Friedman, 2011).",
        "methods": "",
        "results": "The ISS is a useful environment for studying the effects of spaceflight by combining a μg environment with ionizing radiation and CO2 levels that are elevated compared to Earth’s surface (McDonald et al., 2020). The MVP-Fly-01 validation mission (34 days) has enabled comprehensive investigations of the fly CNS (Figure 1A).",
        "discussion": "Deep space exploration will expose space travelers to several environmental challenges, thereby altering the homeostatic equilibrium of various physiological systems, including the CNS. Understanding the risks to CNS and identifying countermeasures to mitigate these risks in astronauts will be crucial to ensure the success of missions to the Moon and Mars."

After just under 13 days, the shuttle landed safely at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) for the last time. Female C57BL/6J mice flew as part of the Commercial Biomedical Testing Module-3 (CBTM-3) payload. Ground controls were maintained at the KSC facility. Subsets of these mice were made available to investigators as part of NASA’s Bio-specimen Sharing Program (BSP). Our group characterized cell phenotype distributions and phagocytic function in the spleen, catecholamine and corticosterone levels in the adrenal glands, and transcriptomics/metabolomics in the liver. Despite decreases in most splenic leukocyte subsets, there were increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS)-related activity.",

After 12 days, 18 hours and 29 minutes, Space Shuttle Atlantis landed safely at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) for the last time. One of the many experiments flown on this historic flight to the International Space Station (ISS) was BioServe Space Technology’s Commercial Biomedical Testing Module-3 (CBTM-3). Sponsored by Amgen, Inc., the last animal flight of the shuttle era was intended to test the impact of their proprietary pharmaceutical agent on spaceflight-induced musculoskeletal atrophy.",
        "methods": "On July 8, 2011, age- and weight-matched, 11 week old, female C57BL/6J mice (n = 15/group) were placed into three Animal Enclosure Modules (AEMs, 2 groups of 5 per AEM separated by a wire mesh) and flown on the Space Shuttle Atlantis (STS-135) for ~13 days.",
        "results": "There were no significant differences in total body mass at the time of sacrifice (AEM 19.5 ± 0.5 g, Flight 18.4 ± 0.5 g). Sample size: n = 8 for AEM ground controls, n = 7 for Flight. However, when calculated as a difference from preflight, baseline mass, we previously reported that spaceflight mice lost significantly more mass compared to AEM controls [35].",
        "discussion": "Spaceflight appears to have had a significant impact on both immune and metabolomic function. These differences occur in the cell count and proportion data (see S1 Discussion), cell function, metabolites and in gene expression."

      "abstract": "Increased oxidative stress is an unavoidable consequence of exposure to the space environment. Our previous studies showed that mice exposed to space for 13.5 days had decreased glutathione levels, suggesting impairments in oxidative defense. Here we performed unbiased, unsupervised and integrated multi-‘omic analyses of metabolomic and transcriptomic datasets from mice flown aboard the Space Shuttle Atlantis. Enrichment analyses of metabolite and gene sets showed significant changes in osmolyte concentrations and pathways related to glycerophospholipid and sphingolipid metabolism, likely consequences of relative dehydration of the spaceflight mice. However, we also found increased enrichment of aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis and purine metabolic pathways, concomitant with enrichment of genes associated with autophagy and the ubiquitin-proteasome. When taken together with a downregulation in nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2-mediated signaling, our analyses suggest that decreased hepatic oxidative defense may lead to aberrant tRNA post-translational processing, induction of degradation programs and senescence-associated mitochondrial dysfunction in response to the spaceflight environment.",
      "sections": {
        "introduction": "Long-duration spaceflight is associated with significant risks including prolonged exposure to microgravity, continuous exposure to low-dose/low-dose rate radiation, psychological and environmental stress and contact with potentially dangerous levels of microbial contamination [1,2,3,4,5]. Radiation is known to induce single (SSB) and double strand (DSB) DNA breaks, permanently damaging nuclear and mitochondrial DNA and leading to early apoptosis or necrosis [6,7,8]. At low-dose/low-dose rates, radiation immediately triggers oxidative stress via a spike in the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Acute psychological stress increases hepatic lipid peroxidation as well as levels of ROS [9], however chronically stressed animals compensate [9,10]. Therefore, exposure to the space environment, characterized by changes in physiological and psychological stress, as well as exposure to low-dose/low-dose rate radiation, may systemically alter ROS levels in a complex fashion [11,12,13].",
        "methods": "Nine-week old weight-matched female C57BL/6J mice were selected for this study because they produce fewer odor annoyance issues and were the only gender approved for flight (n = 15/group). Additionally, all historical data (e.g., STS-118) were obtained on female mice so the use of female mice permitted comparisons across missions, particularly for the musculoskeletal studies that were primary. Mice were housed in Animal Enclosure Modules (AEMs, 10 mice per AEM habitat; 5 per side separated by a wire mesh) and either flown on the Space Shuttle Atlantis (STS-135) for 13.5 days (FLT) or housed at the Space Life Science Laboratory (SLSL) at KSC (Ground AEM controls; AEM).",
        "results": "Brief exposure to the space environment results in significant metabolite changes in mouse liver. (A) PLS-DA analysis was performed on normalized metabolomics data that was subsequently log-transformed and auto-scaled. The first two components are plotted; (B) volcano plot comparing flown in space (FLT) vs. matched ground controls (AEM) considering unequal variance and using a fold change (FC) threshold of 2 and a p (corr)-value threshold of 0.05. Data points in red indicate significant named biochemical features.",
        "discussion": "The unbiased analyses presented here both support our previous results and extend them to show that exposure to the space environment for only 13.5 days results in increased oxidative stress due to elevated ROS and impaired oxidative defense (by way of attenuation of NRF2-related pathways) in the mouse liver. Furthermore, our multi-‘omics studies suggest that accumulation of oxidized proteins coupled with mitochondrial dysfunction may lead to activation of hepatocyte senescence, resulting in hepatocyte lipid accumulation and steatosis."

Multiple organ systems are affected by microgravity and radiation, including the cardiovascular system. Previous transcriptomic studies have sought to reveal the changes in gene expression after spaceflight. However, little is known about the impact of long-term spaceflight on the mouse heart in vivo. This study focuses on the transcriptomic changes in the hearts of female C57BL/6J mice flown on the International Space Station (ISS) for 30 days.",
      "sections": {
        "introduction": "The historic Apollo 11 mission to the moon stimulated a shift into a new era of research, merging biology and aerospace in an effort to achieve a greater understanding of the impact of spaceflight on the human body. Microgravity at low earth orbit (LEO), experienced aboard the International Space Station (ISS), causes changes in gravity-dependent fluid flow within the cardiovascular system [1,2,3].",
        "methods": "Female C57BL/6J mice aged 8–9 weeks old were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Mice were shipped to the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) Space Life Sciences Laboratory (SLSL). Although there were several groups in this study, this report focuses on the transcriptomic changes in the heart when mice are housed in the spaceflight environment for 30 days.",
        "results": "KEGG and Gene Ontology (GO) scatterplots were generated based on the top one hundred significantly (p < 0.01) expressed genes and transcripts in the spaceflight group (Figure 1a–c). Genes that function within the cAMP, cGMP-PKG, and calcium signaling pathways contributing to cell proliferation, cytoskeletal rearrangement, and survival were identified as enriched (Figure 1b).",

        "introduction": "Spaceflight places multiple stresses upon the human body including altered gravity fields and exposure to cosmic radiation, which lead to health risks for spacefaring humans (Institute of Medicine, 2008). Decades of research on astronauts has begun to reveal how humans respond to the spaceflight environment (Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019) but physiological monitoring of astronauts is still limited. Thus, rodent models have been essential for advancing our understanding of how mammals—including humans—respond to spaceflight. This includes the impact of spaceflight on muscle structure (Shen et al., 2017; Spatz et al., 2017; Tascher et al., 2017), liver (Beheshti et al., 2019; Jonscher et al., 2016), and immune functions (Pecaut et al., 2017; Rettig et al., 2017; Ward et al., 2018).",

        "results": "To assess gene expression differences in liver samples from the RR-1 NASA Validation mission (Cadena et al., 2019; Globus and Galazka, 2015; Ronca et al., 2019), RNA was extracted from livers dissected from spaceflight (FLT) and ground control (GC) animals either immediately after euthanasia (immediate preservation, I) or from frozen carcasses after partial thawing (carcass preservation, C) and sequenced following polyA selection (Figure S1).",
        "discussion": "Herein, we show that protocols used to preserve mouse carcasses on-orbit have large effects on gene expression patterns as measured by RNAseq. Indeed, changes in gene expression due to preservation condition overwhelmed those due to spaceflight."

      "abstract": "Natural killer (NK) cells are an important first-line of defense against malignant cells. Because of the potential for increased cancer risk from astronaut exposure to space radiation, we determined whether microgravity present during spaceflight affects the body’s defenses against leukemogenesis.",
      "sections": {
        "introduction": "Natural killer (NK) cells are effector lymphocytes of the innate immune system that perform immunosurveillance and provide a first line of defense against virally-infected cells and cells that undergo malignant transformation, recognizing them and eliminating these aberrant clones, without the need for prior sensitization, before they can proliferate and give rise to disease1. In addition to mediating direct cytolysis of tumor cells, NK cells also serve as a critical bridge to the adaptive immune system, releasing cytokines such as IFN-γ, TNF-α, GM-CSF, and IL-33 and the chemokines MIP-1α, MIP-1β, and RANTES to recruit circulating T cells to the tumor site and stimulate T cell activation and proliferation to enhance the body’s immune response against neoplastic cell division or cancer development2,3. As such, any stressors that negatively affect the inherent anti-tumor properties of NK cells could directly increase the risk of carcinogenesis.",
        "methods": "The human natural killer cell line NK-92MI (ATCC® CRL™-2408) was used for initial cytotoxicity experiments. During expansion, cells were cultured in standard tissue culture flasks in Alpha Minimum Essential medium without ribonucleosides and deoxyribonucleosides but with 2 mM L-glutamine and 1.5 g/L sodium bicarbonate.",
        "results": "To begin to define the impact that exposure to microgravity has upon NK cell function, we incubated NK-92MI cells for 48 h in either: (1) conditions of normal gravity (1 G) in a standard culture T-flask; or (2) conditions of simulated microgravity (sμG) using the NASA-designed Synthecon rotating wall vessel (RWV) system and its associated high-aspect ratio vessels (HARVs).",
        "discussion": "Taken together, these data demonstrate that even fairly brief exposure to conditions of simulated microgravity (sμG) markedly reduces the cytotoxicity of both the NK-92MI cell lines and primary human NK cells from 3 different donors towards two different hematological tumor cell lines (K-562 and MOLT-4)."

To gain insight into S. aureus virulence potential in the spaceflight environment, we analyzed RNA-Seq, cellular proteomics, and metabolomics data from the “Biological Research in Canisters-23” (BRIC-23) GeneLab spaceflight experiment, a mission designed to measure the response of S. aureus to growth in low earth orbit on the international space station.",
      "sections": {
        "introduction": "Staphylococcus aureus is a pernicious pathogen capable of infecting nearly every tissue and organ system in the human body. Most S. aureus strains are resistant to multiple antibiotics, and certain isolates are resistant to nearly all antibiotics used in the clinical setting.",
        "methods": "A general overview of the BRIC-23 flight (FLT) experiment is outlined in Fig. 1, and complete details have been previously described20,21. In brief, two BRIC-PDFUs (each containing five 60 mm Petri dishes with 107 CFU of S. aureus UAMS-123 cells dried on the bottom of each plate) were launched to the ISS on SpaceX CRS-9 on 07/18/2016.",
        "results": "Principle components analysis (PCA) was performed on all quantile normalized Reads Per Kilobase of transcript, per Million mapped reads (RPKM) gene expression values from the BRIC-23 FLT and GC RNA-Seq samples (n = 9 per experimental group) (Fig. 2a).",
        "discussion": "Our analysis of the S. aureus RNA-Seq, proteomics, secretomics, and metabolomics datasets from BRIC-23 indicate that S. aureus undergoes significant alterations in physiology and virulence factor production in the spaceflight environment which could alter its pathogenic potential for astronauts conducting long-term spaceflight missions."

        "introduction": "Growing healthy plants in space is a major goal towards the viability of long-term space missions as plants can provide food for astronauts and benefit mental health. The space environment includes multiple stresses for plant growth including different levels of gravity, radiation, decreased nutrient delivery and water recycling1,2. The International Space Station provides an ideal experimental setting for the study of plant growth and development under space conditions and many experiments have been conducted with plants on the ISS1,3. Reduced gravity on the ISS results in disoriented plant growth unless light is provided to activate directional growth from phototropism. Effects of the spaceflight environment on the ISS include reduced cell elongation4 or altered cell division5 in roots. At the cellular level, the microtubule and actin cytoskeletons as well as the cell wall are altered under microgravity6–8. Other cellular organelles are altered under microgravity conditions include mitochondria, plastids and ER6. Interestingly, vacuole numbers increased in root apical cells for Arabidopsis seedlings grown on the ISS9, and vacuole volume increases in certain cells in microgravity10,11. Moreover, proteins involved in intracellular membrane trafficking were found to show altered abundance in microgravity12–14. Those results suggest vacuolar development as well as trafficking are disrupted in microgravity, but overall, there is a large gap in documenting the effect of spaceflight on the organization of cellular organelles15.",
        "methods": "Arabidopsis ecotype Columbia (Col-0) expressing GFP-TIP2;1 was previously described39 and previously transformed27 with the HDEL-mCherry construct40. The zig-1 mutant was previously described24, and the GFP-TIP2;1 marker was introgressed into this genotype by crossing. The HDEL-mCherry marker40 was separately introduced into zig-1 by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation27 and the two markers were combined by crossing and selection of plants in the F2.",
        "results": "The goal of BRIC-24 was to test whether vacuole fusion is affected by the microgravity environment of the ISS. A previously characterized vacuole fusion assay26,27 was implemented with the BRIC-PDFU hardware. This assay takes advantage of the accumulation of vacuoles in the zig-1 mutant and the rapid induction of vacuole fusion in this mutant upon treatment with Wortmannin (WM)27. Visualization of organelle morphology is accomplished by confocal microscopy of a GFP-tagged vacuolar marker (GFP-TIP2;1)39 and a mCherry-tagged ER marker (HDEL-mCherry)40 previously characterized.",
        "discussion": "Here, we investigated the effect of microgravity on plant vacuole fusion and the association of vacuoles and plastids. The feasibility of chemical treatments in plants on the ISS was demonstrated using the BRIC-PDFU hardware and an optimized plant fixation protocol."

        "introduction": "At varying phases of the life cycle, there are differential nutrient requirements. During pregnancy and lactation, an immense demand for nutrients sustains these challenging physiological states in the mother and fosters growth and development of the fetus and neonate. To support fetal and neonatal growth, major changes in the partitioning of available nutrients occur in maternal tissues, including coordinated shifts in mammary, liver and adipose tissue metabolism that do not jeopardize maternal homeostasis or fetal and neonatal health (Bauman and Currie, 1980). Homeorhetic adaptations are the “coordinated changes in metabolism of body tissues necessary to support a (dominant) developmental or physiological process” (Bauman and Currie, 1980; Bell and Bauman, 1997).",
        "methods": "All animal procedures were approved by the NASA Ames Research Center IACUC. Sixty-four time-bred female Sprague-Dawley rats (Rattus norvegicus; Taconic Farms, Germantown, NY, USA), weighing between 190–280g, were used.",
        "results": "Body mass was 21%, 19%, 10%, 17% and 13% lower in G20, G21, P0, P1 and P3 HG dams versus control dams, respectively (supplementary material Table S1). Mammary glands were significantly (p<0.05) smaller in HG (1.80±0.12g) versus control (2.19±0.11g) dams on G20;",
        "discussion": "Our data suggest that hypergravity exposure causes a shift in maternal metabolism from reproductive to maternal survival at the expense of pup survival."

      "abstract": "Previous publications have shown that BRI1 EMS suppressor 1 (BES1), a positive regulator of the brassinosteroid (BR) signalling pathway, enhances cell divisions in the quiescent centre (QC) and stimulates columella stem cell differentiation. Here, it is demonstrated that BZR1, a BES1 homologue, also promotes cell divisions in the QC, but it suppresses columella stem cell differentiation, opposite to the action of BES1.",
      "sections": {
        "introduction": "The apical regions of plant roots are composed of mitotically inactive quiescent centre (QC) cells and the surrounding meristemic stem cell initials (epidermal-lateral root cap initials, cortical-endodermal initials, stele initials, and columella initials), which form a ‘stem cell niche’ (SCN) (Supplementary Figure S1 available at JXB online; Bennett and Scheres, 2010).",
        "methods": "Wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana (Columbia-0, Col-0), its ethylene biosynthesis mutant eto1-11 and BR-related mutants (det2, bri1-116, bzr1-D, and bri1-116/bzr1-D), and wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana (Enkheim-2, En-2) and its mutant bes1-D plants were used for QC, CSC, and columella cell (CC) phenotype analysis and root-regulating gene expression analysis.",
        "results": "The QC is the source of stem cell initials and is maintained at the G1/S cell cycle checkpoint and thus divides infrequently (Jiang and Feldman, 2005). BR-induced nuclear localization of BES1, a positive regulator of the BR signalling pathways, in the QC promotes QC reactivation, leading to production of two layers of QC cells (Gonzalez-Garcia et al., 2011; Heyman et al., 2013; Vilarrasa-Blasi et al., 2014) and results in CSC differentiation (Gonzalez-Garcia et al., 2011).",
        "discussion": "A root is formed from a reservoir of undifferentiated cells, called root stem cells, in the root apical meristem. QC cells act as integrators for many processes and events that are requisites for root meristem establishment and maintenance."

        "results": "The consistency of the PWB level achieved was high (Fig. 1a). Indeed, all unloaded groups displayed minimal differences between their achieved and desired PWB level, which was further demonstrated by low coefficients of variation (PWB70: 0.54%, PWB40: 1.20%, PWB20: 0.95%).",

        "introduction": "Since Yuri Gagarin first traveled to space in 1961, human spaceflight activity has grown rapidly. One of the most notable events to date was the 1998 launch of the International Space Station (ISS), a lower Earth orbiting research platform, which allows astronauts to live and work in space for up to a year at a time.1 The microgravity environment of space presents an extreme environmental stressor, which induces a multitude of physiological maladaptations including, but not limited to, skeletal muscle and bone loss, cardiovascular decline, immune compromise,2 neuronal damage, and decreased gray matter volume.3 These resemble some of the adverse health changes associated with chronological aging on Earth, and additionally serve as an accelerated model of other non-communicable health concerns such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and obesity.4 As people look to travel further into space and for longer periods than ever before—owing to the rise in commercial spaceflight and increasingly lower cost access to space—understanding the mechanistic underpinnings of spaceflight-induced maladaptation is essential to developing effective countermeasures that promote safe space travel and also benefit health on Earth.",

      "sections": {
        "introduction": "Rodent models have played an integral role in the spaceflight program by permitting the collection of physiological data in support of human space exploration. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) developed the Animal Enclosure Module (AEM) to conduct the rodent spaceflight research on board the Space Shuttle and since its development, the AEM has been used successfully in over 26 rodent spaceflights2–10 with the latest one on STS-135 on 8 July 2011.",
        "methods": "Three ground government support equipment AEM units (Figure 5) were used for the feeding studies of rats and mice. AEM units were built according to flight configurations which, for mouse studies, delineates that each AEM is loaded with two water bags in the water box container with approximately 2 liters of heat-sterilized distilled water per bag.",
        "results": "The body mass measurements (Figure 1) were similar between the vivarium and AEM groups at both time-points during the tests. The average initial (day 0) animal body masses for vivarium and AEM groups were 19.0±0.5 g and 19.0±0.5 g respectively.",
        "discussion": "Several organs were observed to have slight changes in mass, and the following discussion speculates on these potential variations. Although no further tests were conducted to validate these speculations, they are offered as areas of potential further study and as cautions to researchers which may utilize the AEM hardware in spaceflight experiments to study a particular organ system."

Although COVID-19 is responsible for more than 5.4 M deaths till now, more than 40% of infected individuals are asymptomatic carriers as the immune system of the human body can control the SARS-CoV-2 infection.",
      "sections": {
        "introduction": "The current global pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for over 5.4 million death till now. It is now well understood that during COVID-19 infection, the spike protein S1 unit containing the receptor-binding domain (S-RBD) facilitates the virus attachment to humans by binding to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in the nasal epithelial mucosal cells, which is the key path for SARS-CoV-2 entry into human host cells.",
        "methods": "GQDs were developed in a two-step process, as shown in Scheme S1 in the Supporting Information. Initially, graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets were synthesized from natural graphite powder using the modified Hummer’s method as we and others have reported before.",
        "results": "The UV–vis spectra from HNP1 and LL-37 human host defense peptide-attached GQDs, as reported in Figure S2E, show two peaks. The first absorption peak is observed at ∼270 nm, which can be due to the π–π* transition, and the second peak is at ∼306 nm, which can be due to the n−π* transition.",
        "discussion": "In conclusion, in the current article, we show that HNP1 and LL-37 peptide-conjugated GQDs can be used to prevent the delta variant virus entry into the host cells by blocking spike protein RBD binding with ACE2."

      "abstract": "Organismal adaptations to spaceflight have been characterized at the molecular level in model organisms, including Drosophila and C. elegans. Here, we extend molecular work to energy metabolism and sex hormone signaling in mice and humans. We found spaceflight induced changes in insulin and estrogen signaling in rodents and humans. Murine changes were most prominent in the liver, where we observed inhibition of insulin and estrogen receptor signaling with concomitant hepatic insulin resistance and steatosis. Based on the metabolic demand, metabolic pathways mediated by insulin and estrogen vary among muscles, specifically between the soleus and extensor digitorum longus. In humans, spaceflight induced changes in insulin and estrogen related genes and pathways. Pathway analysis demonstrated spaceflight induced changes in insulin resistance, estrogen signaling, stress response, and viral infection. These data strongly suggest the need for further research on the metabolic and reproductive endocrinologic effects of space travel, if we are to become a successful interplanetary species.",

        "introduction": "We have entered an era in which living and working in space is a reality. Studies show that spaceflight has health risks such as central nervous system and cardiovascular dysfunction, cancer risk, immune dysregulation, muscle and bone loss, and fatty liver1. At the molecular level, risks include oxidative stress, DNA damage, cosmic radiation exposure, mitochondrial dysfunction, microbiome shift, and epigenetic alterations1. Of these, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress have been identified as major space-related risks2. Mitochondria are not only the powerhouse of the cell but also the center of many metabolic pathways. Insulin is a highly conserved anabolic and mitogenic peptide hormone that acts as a master regulator of energy metabolism across species, including humans3. It is secreted by the pancreas in response to increased plasma glucose, and exerts its effects on most organs including the kidney and liver as well as skeletal muscle, and bone4. Insulin receptor is a transmembrane receptor belonging to the family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs)5 and undergoes autophosphorylation upon activation, leading to a downstream signaling cascade which influences cellular function, particularly glucose metabolism. Insulin resistance (IR) arises when these downstream molecular pathways do not respond appropriately in target tissues, thus impeding the physiologic response to insulin. In the physiological state, IR can also be observed due to opposing actions from counterregulatory hormones such as glucagon, glucocorticoids, and catecholamines. Insulin resistance is further associated with metabolic abnormalities such as diabetes, lipid dysfunction, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), cardiovascular disease, retinopathy, and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Each of these factors is also interconnected, thus resulting in a potentially vicious cycle.",
        "methods": "All omics data related to mouse samples were obtained from NASA’s GeneLab public omics repository86. The data derived from spaceflight experiments carried out onboard the ISS as part of the Rodent Research-1 (RR-1), RR-5, RR-7, and MHU-2 missions. A description of the experimental design, the corresponding type of tissues, and the data accessed are summarized in Supplementary Table 1. All previous animal experiments and methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines at each principal investigators’ institutions and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use committee (IACUC). A detailed description of the methodology for obtaining tissue samples and processing is available in NASA’s GeneLab platform.",
        "results": "To understand how insulin and estrogen signaling change during spaceflight we examined gene expression in mice that were flown to the International Space Station (ISS) for 37 days. For this purpose, adrenal glands (OSD-98), kidney (OSD-102), liver (OSD-168), eyes (OSD-100), and skeletal muscles (i.e. quadriceps (OSD-103), gastrocnemius (OSD-101), soleus (OSD-104), tibialis anterior (OSD-105), and extensor digitorum longus (OSD-99)) were utilized (Fig. 1a). The transcriptomic data (RNA-seq) was obtained for 16-week-old female mice from the NASA GeneLab platform28 and were analyzed for insulin signaling, estrogen signaling and insulin resistance related genes and pathways. The gene lists for these hormones were obtained from the NCBI resource29 (i.e. ‘insulin signaling’ mus musculus). The greatest number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were observed in the mouse liver (n = 3670), followed by soleus (n = 3518) and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) (n = 1859) muscles. In all, 2677 DEGs were unique to the liver, 2048 DEGs were unique to soleus muscle, and 784 DEGs were unique to EDL (Fig. 1b). The least number of DEGs was noted in the adrenal gland (n = 61) and 28 of them were unique to it (Fig. 1b). There are a total of 1970 unique genes from the NCBI curated gene list which are commonly encountered across insulin resistance, insulin signaling and estrogen signaling pathways. Most of the genes from the NCBI list related to insulin resistance, insulin signaling, and estrogen signaling were downregulated in the liver (Fig. 1c). In total, 645 out of the 1970 unique genes from the NCBI resource had gene expression values across all nine tissues. These genes were divided into seven biologically relevant clusters associated with insulin resistance and signaling (Fig. 1d). In particular, the last cluster (cluster 7) at the bottom of the heatmap were related to Gene Ontology (GO) processes30 such as lipid localization and glycerolipid metabolic processes which are relate",
        "discussion": "Consistent with past reports that insulin signaling is a central regulator of gene expression changes and lipid metabolism in response to spaceflight in the worm, C. elegans64,65, we find that gene expression changes related to insulin signaling occur in spaceflown rodents and humans. Further, we find that estrogen signaling gene expression changes also occur in both spaceflown rodents and humans."

In order to disassociate the skeletal effects of leptin deficiency from those associated with morbid obesity, we evaluated bone mass, architecture, gene expression, and indices of bone turnover in wild type (WT) mice, ob/ob mice fed ad libitum (ob/ob), and ob/ob mice pair fed to WT mice (pair-fed ob/ob).",

      "abstract": "Female mice are often used as preclinical models for osteoporosis but, in contrast to humans, mice exhibit cancellous bone loss during growth. Mice are routinely housed at room temperature (18–23°C), a strategy that exaggerates physiological differences in thermoregulation between mice (obligatory daily heterotherms) and humans (homeotherms). The purpose of this investigation was to assess whether housing female mice at thermoneutral (temperature range where the basal rate of energy production is at equilibrium with heat loss) alters bone growth, turnover and microarchitecture.",

        "introduction": "Mice, because of their small size, short lifespan, and ease of genetic manipulation are a mainstay for cutting edge research in fundamental skeletal biology. In addition, mice are frequently utilized as preclinical models for metabolic bone disease associated with aging, including senile, disuse, and postmenopausal osteoporosis.",
        "methods": "Four-week-old, female B6 and C3H/HeJ (C3H) female mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA). The mice were housed individually in a room on a 12 h light:12 h dark cycle. Food (Teklad 8604, Harlen Laboratories, Indianapolis, IN) and water were provided ad libitum to all animals and body weight and food consumption were monitored weekly for the duration of studies.",
        "results": "C57BL/6J mice housed at 22°C experienced a 62% cancellous bone loss from the distal femur metaphysis during the interval from 8–18 weeks of age and lesser bone loss from the distal femur epiphysis, whereas cancellous and cortical bone mass in 32°C-housed mice were unchanged or increased.",

In essence, mechanosensation is probably the oldest sense and is fundamental for many life functions. The primary way that organisms detect forces is through mechanosensitive (MS) ion channels. The best-studied mechanosensitive channels are from bacteria, and because relatively little is known of mechanosensors from higher organisms, these channels are a model for how a protein can sense and respond to mechanical forces.",
        "methods": "All chimeras were generated using the PCR ligation method (Blount and Krause, 1993; Innis et al., 1990). All other site-directed mutants were generated using Mega primer method as described previously (Levin and Blount, 2004) and all were inserted in the pB10d expression construct (Blount et al., 1996a; Ou et al., 1998).",

Microbial biotechnologies research and development for space sustainability will be translatable to Earth applications, tackling terrestrial environmental issues, thereby supporting the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.",

      "abstract": "Muscle strength is a functional measure of quality of life in humans. Declines in muscle strength are manifested in diseases as well as during inactivity, aging, and space travel. With conserved muscle biology, the simple genetic model C. elegans is a high throughput platform in which to identify molecular mechanisms causing muscle strength loss and to develop interventions based on diet, exercise, and drugs.",
      "sections": {
        "introduction": "Skeletal muscle provides the contractile system critical for animal locomotion across phyla. The conserved biology of muscle includes sarcomere composition and organization, the calcium-initiated contractile mechanism, and the ATP-driven translocation of actin and myosin for force generation1, 2. A powerful indicator of muscle health is strength —a measure of maximum force that can be voluntarily exerted for a given task.",
        "methods": "C. elegans were maintained on E. coli OP50 bacterial lawns using standard protocol31. Wild-type (WT) animals were Bristol isolate (N2). Other strains used in this study were unc-52(e669), unc-112(r367ts)V, unc-17(e245), and lon-2(e678)X.",
        "results": "At the core of the NemaFlex technology is a liquid-filled microfluidic chamber containing elastic micropillars dangling from the chamber roof that can be deformed by a nematode push (Fig. 1c, d). As C. elegans threads through the pillars, the individual pillar deflections Δ are quantified using a microscope-camera system and image analysis (see Supplementary Movie 2).",
        "discussion": "Here we have optimized the micropillar forest design, defined the measurement conditions, and fine-tuned the workflow analysis so that NemaFlex can reliably score the maximum exertable force in C. elegans."

        "introduction": "Humankind as long been fascinated by space exploration. Yuri Gagarin first showed in 1961 that humans could survive in space, and Neil Armstrong and Edwin ‘Buzz’ Aldrin became the first to walk on the moon in 1969. Now, the International Space Station (ISS), a multinational collaborative station that orbits Earth, has been continuously occupied with crew since November 2000. Into the future, both governmental space agencies and private companies plan to send crewed missions to Mars and beyond. Research to date, however, makes evident that spaceflight poses health risks to the human body, including detrimental effects to musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, and immune systems (Crucian et al., 2018; Fitts et al., 2001; Shen and Frishman, 2019; Sibonga, 2013; Williams et al., 2009). Particularly striking is the loss of up to 20% of muscle mass in short-duration spaceflights (Adams et al., 2003; Edgerton et al., 1995), which can be ameliorated by regular physical exercise (Loehr et al., 2015). Much less is known about the effects of spaceflight on neuronal morphology and function, especially in vivo and at the single-neuron level. Given the impracticality of conducting such studies in humans, the use of animal models in which detailed high-resolution neuronal analyses can be performed is invaluable for assessing conserved neuronal responses to spaceflight and developing effective countermeasures to mitigate the consequences of long-duration missions.",
        "methods": "All methods can be found in the accompanying Transparent methods supplemental file.",
        "results": "For all experiments presented in this study, we grew C. elegans in a liquid culture of S-Basal with freeze-dried E. coli OP50 as a food source. Prior to launch, we cultured synchronized populations of young adult nematodes that we loaded into polyethylene (PE) bags with 6.5 mL of liquid culture (∼300 animals/bag) on December 2, 2018 (see detailed optimization of culture conditions (Pollard et al., 2020)). Importantly, given our goal of assessing the effects of spaceflight during adult life rather than during animal development, we added 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine (FUdR) to the culture bags to suppress production of progeny and to guarantee that the animals we loaded into the bags would be the same ones we scored upon their return to Earth, as opposed to their progeny. Our samples were loaded into SpaceX CRS-16, the 16th Commercial Resupply Service mission to the ISS, and launched on December 5, 2018 aboard a Falcon 9 rocket. SpaceX CRS-16 docked to the ISS on December 8, 2018, and the C. elegans samples, which were kept in cold stowage (8–13°C) once introduced into their flight bags, were transferred to 20°C for five days, beginning on December 9, 2018. After five days, the C. elegans culture bags were transferred to −80°C and kept frozen until return to Earth (Figure 1). For ground control samples, we loaded young adult nematodes into PE bags on December 5, 2018 and exposed C. elegans to the same time frame/temperatures as space samples but maintained cultures on Earth. A key aspect of our experimental design is thus that we generated middle-aged nematodes that experienced most of their physiological aging in microgravity (ISS) vs. normal gravity (Earth).",
        "discussion": "Spaceflight has been shown to induce adverse effects on the human body at multiple levels, including in musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, and immune systems (Crucian et al., 2018; Fitts et al., 2001; Shen and Frishman, 2019; Sibonga, 2013; Williams et al., 2009). However, the effect of spaceflight on neuronal morphology and function, especially in vivo, is largely unknown. In this study, we took advantage of the unique characteristics of the nematode C. elegans (e.g. ease of culture in large numbers and transparent body allowing for in vivo imaging of fluorescently labeled transgenic lines) to address how spaceflight affects the morphology of different adult neurons and the response to a neuronal proteotoxic stress. We show that spaceflight induces extensive remodeling of the PVD dendritic tree in adult C. elegans relative to ground control animals, whereas touch receptor neurons exhibit modest morphological changes in response to spaceflight. Importantly, hyperbranching is a consistent response to spaceflight between different adult neuron types. We also report on a striking difference in the ability to respond to a neuronal proteostress (i.e., mCherry overexpression) in spaceflight vs. Earth samples, in which adults that aged on the ISS exhibited accumulated extruded neuronal garbage outside the neurons, distributed in neighboring tissues. Our observations raise the intriguing possibility that spaceflight may impair neuronal proteostasis/clearance pathways, which may hold significant health implications for long-duration spaceflights."

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) can correct disease-related mitochondrial metabolic deficiencies, and supraphysiological H2S concentrations can pro health span. However, the efficacy and mechanisms of mitochondrion-targeted sulfide delivery molecules (mtH2S) administered across the adult life course are unknown.",
      "sections": {
        "introduction": "Deteriorating health across the life course is a major societal burden, and effective therapeutics are lacking. Mitochondrial decline has long been associated with age-related health loss.",

        "results": "We first investigated the effects of mitochondrion-targeted and nontargeted H2S donors on C. elegans life span. Dosing L1 larvae with the untargeted sulfide donor NaGYY4137 (100 µM) increased maximal life span by 20 % (P < 0.0001) (Fig. 1A), which is comparable to previous studies using GYY4137 (morpholine salt) and related compounds (18, 19).",

      "abstract": "Age‐related muscle decline (sarcopenia) associates with numerous health risk factors and poor quality of life. Drugs that counter sarcopenia without harmful side effects are lacking, and repurposing existing pharmaceuticals could expedite realistic clinical options. Recent studies suggest bisphosphonates promote muscle health; however, the efficacy of bisphosphonates as an anti‐sarcopenic therapy is currently unclear.",
      "sections": {
        "introduction": "Age‐related muscle decline, termed ‘sarcopenia’, is classified as a specific disease associated with numerous health risk factors in the elderly, prevalent in at least 10% of older populations and up to 31% as a co‐morbidity. Despite associated annual healthcare costs that run into the billions and significant impacts on individual quality of life and all‐cause mortality, efficacious treatment strategies against sarcopenia remain limited.",
        "methods": "Wild‐type (N2 stain) animals were age synchronized by gravity flotation and ~80 L1 larvae were placed on 33 mm petri dishes (20 L1 per 33 mm plate) containing 2 mL NGM agar [50 mM NaCl, 0.25% (w/v) bacteriological peptone, 1.7% (w/v) agar, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgSO4, 25 mM KH2PO4 (pH 6), 12.9 μM cholesterol] and seeded with 200 μL of OP50 Escherichia coli bacteria.",
        "results": "Higher ZA concentrations (500 and 100 μM) were larval lethal, and 10 μM ZA shortened lifespan (median survival = 11 vs. 14 days for controls, P < 0.0001; Figure 1A) without significantly impairing healthspan (animal movement AUC = 758.9 ± 37.08 vs. 833.9 ± 59.91 for controls, P > 0.05; Figure 1A).",
        "discussion": "Despite the socio‐economic implications, treatment options for sarcopenia remain mostly limited to modifiable lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise, which are incompletely effective."

      "sections": {
        "introduction": "Fungi are a source of natural products that are useful to humankind. A variety of bioactive compounds produced by fungi are used in pharmaceutical and food industries, agriculture, and beyond. However, some fungi are plant, animal, and human pathogens. Fungal pathogens could cause serious health complications in immunocompromised populations. Pathogenic fungi can produce a range of secondary metabolites (SMs) that influence their virulence (melanins, siderophores, species-specific toxins) and immunologic potential.",
        "methods": "Aspergillus fumigatus is a saprophytic, filamentous fungus that is ubiquitous outdoors (soil, decaying vegetation) and indoors (hospitals, simulated closed habitats, etc.). Aspergillus fumigatus can adapt to various environmental conditions and form airborne conidia that are the inoculum for a variety of diseases (e.g., noninvasive and invasive pulmonary infections, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, etc.) in immunocompromised hosts.",
        "results": "In on-going microbial observatory experiments on the International Space Station (ISS), molecular phylogeny and radiation resistance of several fungal isolates were characterized. Two Aspergillus fumigatus strains, ISSFT-021 and IF1SW-F4, were isolated from a HEPA filter (1) and cupola wall (unpublished) of the ISS.",
        "discussion": "Because A. fumigatus is an opportunistic pathogen causing pathologies ranging from allergic asthma to invasive aspergillosis, we assessed several pathogenic characteristics of the ISS isolates in comparison to two experimentally established clinical isolates, Af293 (2) and CEA10 (3). Virulence assessment in a larval zebrafish model of invasive aspergillosis revealed both ISSFT-021 and IF1SW-F4 as significantly more lethal compared to both clinical isolates (Af293 and CEA10) (4). In addition, the ISS strains ISSFT-021 and IF1SW-F4 exhibited significantly greater resistance to UV254 doses when compared to clinical isolates (4, 5)."

      "abstract": "Tardigrades, microscopic animals that survive a broad range of environmental stresses, express a unique set of proteins termed tardigrade-specific intrinsically disordered proteins (TDPs). TDPs are often expressed at high levels in tardigrades upon desiccation, and appear to mediate stress adaptation.",
      "sections": {
        "introduction": "Water is the universal solvent essential for survival. However, several organisms demonstrate remarkable abilities to withstand an almost complete loss of water for a prolonged time and recover upon rehydration1,2. This phenomenon of “anhydrobiosis”, or “life without water” has attracted a great deal of attention because it may reveal Nature’s strategies to endure adverse environments and open up ways to achieve efficient preservation of living matter.",
        "methods": "SAHS protein sequences used for expression in E. coli (Figure S2) were obtained from Uniprot database (https://www.uniprot.org). Protein subcellular localization and signal peptides were predicted using TargetP 2.0 server available at https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk18.",
        "results": "We selected 12 SAHS proteins from R. varieornatus and one from H. exemplaris to test for expression in the E. coli cytoplasm (Table S1). R. varieornatus is the most desiccation-resistant tardigrade and is well-characterized; a draft genome sequence is available, and crystal structures of two SAHS proteins from this organism have been solved16,17.",
        "discussion": "In this study, we tested the proteins belonging to the SAHS family of tardigrade proteins for their potential to protect diverse biological structures. In addition, we observed that the SAHS proteins undergo structural shift upon exposure to a desiccation-mimicking compound and used a diverse set of experimental and computational approaches to suggest possible models of how the structural transition of SAHS proteins might occur to protect biological structures."

      "abstract": "The International Space Station (ISS) is a closed system inhabited by microorganisms originating from life support systems, cargo, and crew that are exposed to unique selective pressures such as microgravity. To date, mandatory microbial monitoring and observational studies of spacecraft and space stations have been conducted by traditional culture methods, although it is known that many microbes cannot be cultured with standard techniques. To fully appreciate the true number and diversity of microbes that survive in the ISS, molecular and culture-based methods were used to assess microbial communities on ISS surfaces. Samples were taken at eight pre-defined locations during three flight missions spanning 14 months and analyzed upon return to Earth.",
      "sections": {
        "introduction": "The International Space Station (ISS) is the largest human space platform in low Earth orbit (~ 400 km above Earth’s surface) and for the last 17 years it has been continuously inhabited by an international community of astronauts performing space research. The ISS is a hermetically sealed closed system, subjected to microgravity, radiation, elevated carbon dioxide, and the recirculation of air through HEPA filters and is considered an “extreme environment” [1, 2]. Microbes are known to survive and even thrive in extreme environments, and the microbes that are present on the ISS may have existed since the inception of the ISS while others may be introduced each time new astronauts or payloads arrive.",
        "methods": "Sampling wipes were prepared at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL; Pasadena, CA). Briefly, each polyester wipe (9″ × 9″; ITW Texwipe, Mahwah, NJ) was folded two times and soaked in 15 mL of sterile molecular grade water (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for 30 min followed by the transfer to a sterile zip lock bag [73]. The sampling kit was assembled at NASA Ames Research Center (ARC, Moffett Field, CA). The implementation team at NASA ARC delivered the kit to the Cargo Mission Contract at Johnson Space Center (Texas) which was then transferred to Kennedy Space Center (Florida) in order to be loaded into the Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) Dragon spacecraft prior to launch. Each sampling kit was sent to the ISS onboard the SpaceX-5, -6, -8, rockets and returned to the Earth onboard the Russian vehicle (Soyuz TM-14) and Dragon capsule (SpX-6 or -8). Eight different locations were sampled on the ISS using the polyester wipes described above (see Fig. 1 for a summary of the sampling locations). The metadata associated with the samples and collections is summarized in Additional file 6: Table S3.",
        "results": "Twenty-four surface wipes were collected from eight locations across the ISS during three flight missions over the course of 14 months. In addition to these 24 wipes, wipes that were taken out of the kits and exposed to the ISS environment, but not used for sampling, were designated as controls and processed in parallel with the sample wipes. A summary of the sampled locations and the associated metadata is presented in Fig. 1 and Table 1.",
        "discussion": "The ISS environmental microbiome was characterized from eight locations throughout the ISS during three flight sampling events over a period of 14 months. This allowed the examination of temporal and spatial distribution of microbial populations on the ISS. This is the first study to utilize culture, qPCR, and amplicon sequencing to study the surfaces of the US segment and revealed a diverse intact/viable population of bacteria and fungi that changed over time but were similar across locations."

        "introduction": "Natural products are back at the center of attention as pharmaceutical leads, as exemplified by the recent discoveries of bioactive natural product drugs (Fischbach and Walsh, 2009; Harvey et al., 2015; Li and Vederas, 2009; Ling et al., 2015). Recent advances in metagenomics are transforming the field of natural product discovery by enabling the recovery of microbial genomes directly from the environmental samples. This has revolutionized our understanding about the microbial composition of various communities and their biosynthetic gene clusters. Biosynthetic gene cluster are sets of genes that synthesize microbial small molecules from simple building blocks. The metagenomes of microbial communities contain thousands of biosynthetic gene clusters with unknown small molecule products, making them an untapped resource for the future antimicrobial drug discovery (Charlop-Powers et al., 2016; Donia et al., 2014; Hadjithomas et al., 2015).",
        "methods": "MetaMiner pipeline analyzes the paired genome/metagenome assemblies and tandem mass spectra from isolated microbes or bacterial/fungal communities. Starting from the genome assemblies, MetaMiner (a) identifies putative Biosynthetic gene cluster and the corresponding precursor peptides, (b) constructs target and decoy putative RiPP structure databases (c) matches tandem mass spectra against the constructed post-translationally modified RiPP structures database using Dereplicator, and (d) enlarges the set of described RiPPs via spectral networking (Bandeira et al., 2007; Watrous et al., 2012).",

        "discussion": "While recent genome mining efforts have revealed over 20,000 hypothetical RiPP-encoding biosynthetic gene clusters (Hadjithomas et al., 2015), only 35 RiPPs matching these biosynthetic gene clusters have been identified so far. To keep pace with the speed of microbial genome sequencing, high-throughput methods for structure elucidation of RiPPs are needed that combine metagenomics, genome mining, and peptidomics. MetaMiner extends our previous RiPPquest tool (limited to lanthipeptides) to lassopeptides, LAPs, linaridins, glycocins, cyanobactins, and proteusins, and enables the blind search for RiPPs with unusual modifications."

While humans also encounter these challenges during space flight and, indeed, our physiology is impacted by prolonged exposure—microbes possess the unique ability to adapt quickly due to rapid cell division (thereby mutation) and the acquisition of external DNA elements through horizontal gene transfer (HGT) [1].",

      "abstract": "The International Space Station (ISS) stands as a testament to human achievement in space exploration. Despite its highly controlled environment, characterised by microgravity, increased CO2 levels, and elevated solar radiation, microorganisms occupy a unique niche. These microbial inhabitants play a significant role in influencing the health and well-being of astronauts on board. One microorganism of particular interest in our study is Enterobacter bugandensis, primarily found in clinical specimens including the human gastrointestinal tract, and also reported to possess pathogenic traits, leading to a plethora of infections.",
      "sections": {
        "introduction": "Microorganisms within built environments profoundly affect the health of inhabitants. The International Space Station (ISS), a highly controlled built environment harbouring extreme conditions such as microgravity, solar radiation, and elevated CO2 levels, offers a unique place for studying microbial survival and adaptation [1]. Recent studies have demonstrated that microorganisms exposed to microgravity can acquire antibiotic resistance and heightened virulence via rapid mutations and horizontal gene transfer [2–4]. Prolonged space travel under microgravity can also compromise astronauts’ immune systems, elevating their vulnerability to diseases [5]. The microbial population of the ISS might potentially impact astronauts’ microbiomes and get replenished by the arrival of new crew [6]. Thus, understanding microbial colonisation, succession, and interactions is pivotal for ensuring astronaut well-being and managing microbial risks in isolated and confined human habitats.",
        "methods": "In this study, we utilised publicly available annotated genomes of E. bugandensis (NCBI taxonomic ID 881260) from the NCBI GenBank sequence database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/, accessed on July 17, 2023) using command line tools NCBI Entrez Direct (EDirect) and bit [56]. We downloaded 211 genomes, including 12 genomes of ISS strains and one MAG generated from the metagenome during the Microbial Tracking-1 mission.",
        "results": "We obtained 211 assembled genomes, annotated as E. bugandensis, from the publicly available National Center for Biotechnology Information’s (NCBI) GenBank sequence database [20]. Among these genomes, 12 were isolated from three different locations aboard the ISS during the first Flight of the MT-1 mission: four from the Air Control (AC) samples, one from the Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED), and seven from the Waste and Hygiene Compartment (WHC).",
        "discussion": "In this study, we discussed the adaptation of a multidrug-resistant, nosocomial BSL-2 pathogen, E. bugandensis, in the unique built environment of the ISS, and its potential succession. Several studies have highlighted the prevalence of microorganisms on ISS surfaces associated with humans, including opportunistic pathogens and discussed the importance of studying them [1, 3]. E. bugandensis, which is also an opportunistic pathogen, was observed to be present in the ISS during the cataloguing of viable microbial communities [1, 19]."

      "abstract": "Reduced weight bearing, and to a lesser extent radiation, during spaceflight have been shown as potential hazards to astronaut joint health. These hazards combined effect to the knee and hip joints are not well defined, particularly with low-dose exposure to radiation. In this study, we examined the individual and combined effects of varying low-dose radiation (≤1 Gy) and reduced weight bearing on the cartilage of the knee and hip joints.",
      "sections": {
        "introduction": "Astronauts must maintain their musculoskeletal health during spaceflight to ensure mission success. Joint loading on Earth is necessary to maintain structural integrity, proper function and homeostasis of cartilage and other tissues constituting load-bearing synovial joints (1, 2). Thus, the reduced weight bearing experienced with spaceflight represents a substantial challenge to maintaining the health of synovial joints (3–6).",
        "methods": "Eighty female C57BL/6 mice from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA) were purchased at 16 weeks of age and housed under a 12:12 h light-dark schedule at 26°C. After one week of acclimation, mice were divided into eight groups of 10 mice per group. Four groups were randomly selected to undergo HLU via tail suspension, while four groups remained full-weight bearing in cages (ground).",
        "results": "A main effect of radiation (F3,68 = 4.52; P = 0.006) on cartilage volume was identified, with a marginal (F1,68 = 2.66; P = 0.11) load effect. Relative to ground-sham, the volume of cartilage was significantly reduced (Fig. 1) in the following manner: ground-0.1 Gy (−23%); ground-0.5 Gy (−20%); ground-1 GY (−23%); HLU-0.5 Gy (−27%); and HLU-1.0 Gy (−22%).",
        "discussion": "The main findings of this study are that HLU and exposure to low-dose radiation causes degradation and an arthritic phenotype in the knees and hips of mice, with histologic/imaging and serum biomarker evidence suggesting reduced weight-bearing and low-dose radiation cause an early, catabolic response."

      "abstract": "Both microgravity and radiation exposure in the spaceflight environment have been identified as hazards to astronaut health and performance. Substantial study has been focused on understanding the biology and risks associated with prolonged exposure to microgravity, and the hazards presented by radiation from galactic cosmic rays (GCR) and solar particle events (SPEs) outside of low earth orbit (LEO). To date, the majority of the ground-based analogues (e.g., rodent or cell culture studies) that investigate the biology of and risks associated with spaceflight hazards will focus on an individual hazard in isolation. However, astronauts will face these challenges simultaneously Combined hazard studies are necessary for understanding the risks astronauts face as they travel outside of LEO, and are also critical for countermeasure development.",
      "sections": {
        "introduction": "Both microgravity and radiation exposure in the spaceflight environment have been identified as challenges to astronaut health and performance1–6. While substantial study has been focused on understanding the biology and risks associated with prolonged exposure to microgravity and the hazards presented by radiation within and outside of low earth orbit (LEO), other hazards exist that can impair individual and team performance and well-being. These include the experience of isolation from social groups and networks in confined and extreme environments7–10 combined with lack of sleep quality and quantity with disrupted circadian cycles3,8,11–13. NASA’s research portfolio which examines spaceflight hazards to astronaut health and performance heavily rely on ground-based analogues using rodent models, with most studies focusing on a single hazard.",
        "skeletal response": "Spaceflight environmental conditions, particularly microgravity and low-dose radiation, represent a risk to astronaut bone health. In the absence of mitigation strategies, spaceflight can lead to decrements in bone mass and strength85. Crew members returning from a 4–6 month mission on the ISS had reduced areal bone mineral density (aBMD) of the hip and spine. The rate of bone loss was found to be site-specific, with a 1.4–1.5% and 0.9% decrease in aBMD of the hip and spine respectively per month in the ISS.",
        "ocular response": "There has been an increase in the incidence of the ocular problem reported in astronauts during and after space shuttle missions or orbits aboard ISS3. As previously noted, this syndrome, known as spaceflight associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS), is characterized by pathophysiology symptoms including optic disc edema, globe flattening, choroidal and retinal folds, hyperopic refractive error shifts, and nerve fiber layer infarcts (i.e., cotton wool spots)115–117.",
        "central nervous system (CNS) response": "Any deterioration in the ability of the astronauts to perceive or respond to changes in their situation could have disastrous consequences, as could changes in the mental health of the astronauts. The ability of astronauts to successfully complete a deep space mission, such as the ones planned for Mars, will thus be highly dependent upon a fully functional CNS.",
        "cardiovascular response": "The vascular endothelium is an important regulator of vascular tone in arterial, venous, and lymphatic vessels, and is vital for the protection of arteries from the development of atherosclerotic plaque.",
        "stem cell response": "Tissue regeneration is both a highly mechanosensitive and radiosensitive process, relying heavily on mechanical cues imposed by Earth’s gravity205 and protection by the magnetosphere from harmful ionizing radiation.",
        "conclusions and additional considerations regarding the HLU model": "In LEO, the influence of microgravity on physiological systems is the most prominent spaceflight factor."

        "introduction": "Osteoarthritis (OA) can lead to pain and disability resulting in decreased health-related quality of life, with associated loss of productivity and high treatment-related costs1,2. The reasons for knee OA are thought to be a complex interaction between patient risk factors (age, sex, race, genetic factors, obesity, diet, exercise) and abnormal mechanical loading of the joint (posttraumatic or malalignment)3. In particular, articular cartilage and menisci are sensitive to different loading conditions, and the meniscal degradation and loss of function that occurs in relation to risk factors may result in cartilage degradation and subsequent OA4,5.",

      "abstract": "Tissue preservation is a minimal requirement for the success of plant RNA and protein expression studies. The standard of snap-freezing in liquid nitrogen is not always practical or possible. RNAlater, a concentrated solution of ammonium and cesium sulfates, has become a standard preservative in the absence of liquid nitrogen. Here, we demonstrate the effectiveness of RNAlater in preserving both RNA and proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana tissues for use in RNAseq and LC-MS/MS analysis of proteins. While successful in preserving plant material, a transcriptomic and proteomic response is evident. Specifically, 5770 gene transcripts, 84 soluble proteins, and 120 membrane-bound proteins were found to be differentially expressed at a log-fold change of ±1 (P ≤ 0.05). This response is mirrored in the abundance of post-translational modifications, with 23 of the 108 (21.3%) phosphorylated proteins showing altered abundance at a log-fold change of ±1 (P ≤ 0.05). While RNAlater is effective in preserving biological information, our findings warrant caution in its use for transcriptomic and proteomic experiments.",
      "sections": {
        "introduction": "For the success of transcriptomic and proteomic experiments sufficient quality and quantity of RNA or protein is essential. The ability to accurately preserve samples prior to extraction provides researchers flexibility with experimental design. Snap freezing in liquid nitrogen has been the standard technique for molecular and cell biologists and provides ideal preservation of proteins and nucleic acids for long periods when stored at -80°C. However, field experiments, remote regions of the world, and areas with insufficient infrastructure to allow for access to liquid nitrogen necessitate the use of fixatives [1,2].",
        "methods": "Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heyn. var Columbia seeds (Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center, Columbus, Ohio, USA) were used for all experiments. Forty-four aliquots of 0.016 ± 0.002 g of seeds (approximately 800–900 seeds per plate) were surface sterilized with 30% (v/v) bleach and 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20 for 20 min, washed with sterile water (5x), then dried onto 60 mm round filter paper to facilitate plating. Seeds were spread onto 60 mm round Petri plates containing 0.5 X MS media (Caisson) with 1% sucrose and 1% agar. Seeds were cold stratified then transferred to 22°C for germination and growth. After 72 hours, half of the samples were fixed in RNAlater for 12 hours prior to freezing at -80°C, while the remaining seedlings were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen.",
        "results": "One caution with using RNAlater is the rate of its diffusion through tissues that could lead to uneven preservation of cells across tissues. Because RNAlater denatures transcriptional machinery, uneven preservation across tissues could lead to a transcriptomic or proteomic response. To determine if RNAlater treatment impacted transcript levels in Arabidopsis thaliana, etiolated seedlings were grown for 72 hours then either snap frozen in liquid N2, or Incubated for 12 h in RNAlater at room temperature followed by freezing at -80°C. RNAseq was performed and transcripts compared to assess differential gene expression. Between 17 and 30 million read pairs for each biological replicate were aligned to the TAIR10 assembly using STAR. For each replicate, at least 27,000 unique genes were detected using HTSeq, with at least 15,000 per replicate at greater than 5 counts per million. The ribosomal fraction was below 2% in all replicates.",
        "discussion": "RNAlater is a valuable fixative used for preservation of biological samples. The solution denatures proteases and RNases to preserve RNA and protein integrity for downstream analysis. While many studies have successfully utilized RNAlater as a preservative, few studies have directly compared the effects of this fixative on stability of RNA, protein and post-translational modifications."

Microbial studies in space and other extreme environments on Earth have shown the ability for bacteria and fungi to adapt and change compared to “normal” conditions. Some of these changes, like biofilm formation, can impact astronaut health and spacecraft integrity in a negative way, while others, such as a propensity for plastic degradation, can promote self-sufficiency and sustainability in space.

      "abstract": "Finding sustainable approaches to achieve independence from terrestrial resources is of pivotal importance for the future of space exploration. This is relevant not only to establish viable space exploration beyond low Earth–orbit, but also for ethical considerations associated with the generation of space waste and the preservation of extra-terrestrial environments. Here we propose and highlight a series of microbial biotechnologies uniquely suited to establish sustainable processes for in situ resource utilization and loop-closure. Microbial biotechnologies research and development for space sustainability will be translatable to Earth applications, tackling terrestrial environmental issues, thereby supporting the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.",

The need for sustainability in space exploration, as well as the exploitation of space, is becoming more evident with the strengthening desire for the expansion of human activities beyond Earth-orbit, pursued by public and private sectors alike.",

      "abstract": "Space exploration and extraterrestrial civilization have fascinated humankind since the earliest days of human history. It was only in the last century that humankind finally began taking significant steps towards these goals by sending astronauts into space, landing on the moon, and building the International Space Station. However, space voyage is very challenging and dangerous, and astronauts are under constant space radiation and microgravity. It has been shown that astronauts are at a high risk of developing a broad range of diseases/disorders. Thus, it is critical to develop a rapid and effective assay to monitor astronauts’ health in space.",

        "introduction": "Space exploration and extraterrestrial civilization have continually fascinated humankind; however, it was only in the last century that humankind finally took a solid step forward by sending astronauts into space and landing on the moon [2,3]. In the 21st century, humankind has made another great leap forward in space exploration: expediting the International Space Station (ISS) program [4], sending unmanned rovers to seek signs of life on Mars [5,6], and starting private space ventures [7,8]. In addition, NASA (The National Aeronautics and Space Administration) is planning to send astronauts back to the moon in 2024 and to Mars in the 2030s [9]. Through all these endeavors, we have seen the twilight of crewed space missions going beyond our harbor (Earth) and into deep space.",

It contains gene expression profiles for 10 astronauts (8 male and 2 female) that stayed in the ISS between July 2009 and February 2013.",

      "abstract": "Spaceflight has several detrimental effects on the physiology of astronauts, many of which are recapitulated in rodent models. Mouse studies performed on the Space Shuttle showed disruption of lipid metabolism in liver. However, given that these animals were not sacrificed on-orbit and instead returned live to earth, it is unclear if these disruptions were solely induced by space stressors (e.g. microgravity, space radiation) or in part explained by the stress of return to Earth.",
      "sections": {
        "introduction": "Spaceflight affects several physiological and biochemical processes in astronauts and rodent models. The most reported changes from the space environment are in muscle and bone loss1,2. Several studies also indicate that spaceflight affects components of the immune system, including the distribution and functionality of peripheral leukocytes, and activity of cytokines3. In addition, several decades of spaceflight investigations have eluded that there are subclinical diabetogenic changes that happen in microgravity4.",
        "methods": "The omics data for the mouse liver samples were obtained from NASA’s GeneLab public omics repository (https://genelab.nasa.gov/)19–21 from previous experiments performed by previous investigators from three spaceflight missions, Rodent Research-1 (RR-1) (with samples from both NASA and CASIS)58,59, and Rodent Research-3 (RR-3)60 and STS-13561.",
        "results": "To assess the severity of steatosis and inflammation, liver samples were stained in hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and ORO and analyzed by light microscopy and digital image analysis (DIA)22 (Fig. 1A).",
        "discussion": "The current investigation demonstrates fluctuations in the temporal patterns of biochemical signal transduction pathways caused by microgravity in three distinct spaceflight datasets (RR1-NASA, RR1-CASIS and RR3) involving RNA-seq and proteomics data analysis compared to microarray data from STS-135."

      "abstract": "Over the past 30 years, organs-on-a-chip (OOCs) have emerged as a robust alternative to address the technological challenges associated with current in vitro and in vivo options. Although OOCs offer improved bio-relevance and controlled complexity, broad adoption has remained limited. Most approaches to characterize on-chip structure and function require human intervention, limiting device translation and feasibility. Here, we introduce a new fiber optic-based sensing platform that enables automated, temporal luminescence sensing on-chip, validated for real-time readout of epithelial and endothelial barrier function under cytokine-induced inflammation. Our platform, capable of at least 1 μM resolution, tracked paracellular transport in situ for 9 days of culture under perfusion on-chip. These results offer an alternative sensing approach for continuous, non-invasive luminescence monitoring in OOCs.",
      "sections": {
        "introduction": "Organs-on-a-chip (OOCs) have significantly advanced human disease modelling and drug development, offering improved bio-relevance and controlled complexity by integrating physical and chemical stimuli matched to physiologically relevant conditions.1–4 Although significant innovations have been made toward recreating organ-specific physiology on chip, the methods available to study the structure and function of the cell microenvironment are still limited.5–7 Established analysis approaches, such as fluorescence microscopy, often rely on laborious offline workflows that yield acute or terminal time-point data.8,9 These complex techniques require substantial manual perturbations, frequently adding environmental and user-based variability to inherently inconsistent biological samples. As the OOC field continues to evolve, there is a unique opportunity to engineer improved in situ characterization methods into organ-chip devices. It is essential to develop novel approaches that address current limitations and enable real-time readout of relevant physiological parameters in OOCs to improve the reliability and robustness of these systems.",
        "methods": "Our fiber photometry platform consists of two CMOS cameras capable of imaging the proximal end of fiber optic patch cables, with filters and dichroic mirrors to isolate excitation and emission wavelengths. The optical setup was engineered for simultaneous dual-channel recording, enabling continuous monitoring of apical and basal organ-chip compartments by independent, duplicate optical components to isolate channel recordings.",
        "results": "Our previously established layer-by-layer gut-on-a-chip32,33 was adapted to add fiber optic insertion channels to the upper and lower fluidic layers (Fig. 1A and C). The 500 μm wide fiber channels were positioned at the outlets to detect the exit concentration of fluorophore from each fluidic layer.",

Further, treatment of intact and ovariectomized mice with mBMPR1A‐mFc leads to increased bone mass, and improved bone microarchitecture and strength, via increased bone formation and reduced resorption.",
      "sections": {
        "introduction": "Mechanical loading is essential to skeletal health, because muscle and bone atrophy occur in the setting of disuse. This disuse osteoporosis results in bone loss rates of 1% to 2% per month at weight bearing sites in those exposed to prolonged periods of reduced mechanical loading, such as occurs with paralysis, bed rest during recovery from injury or illness, or spaceflight.",
        "methods": "Using baseline body mass and total body BMD to minimize group differences, we assigned 12‐week‐old female C57Bl/6J mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME, USA) to one of two loading groups: HLU or control (CON), and one of two treatment groups: mBMPR1A‐mFc or vehicle (VEH), resulting in four experimental groups (n = 10 each): (i) CON‐VEH; (ii) CON‐mBMPR1A‐mFc; (iii) HLU‐VEH; and (iv) HLU‐mBMPR1A‐mFc.",
        "results": "Body mass was unchanged in the CON‐VEH and CON‐mBMPR1A‐mFc groups, whereas both HLU groups experienced a transient decrease in body mass compared to baseline in the first 3 days.",

      "abstract": "Space travel is a growing area of interest and includes initiatives such as NASA’s Moon-to-Mars Mission. Reports on the cardiovascular effects of space travel reveal changes in morphology, metabolism, and function of the cardiovascular system. In this study, the cardiovascular response to immunization in space was studied in mice which were housed and immunized while on the International Space Station (ISS). Mice were immunized with tetanus toxoid combined with the adjuvant CpG (TT + CpG) and the effects of vaccination in space were studied using transcriptomics.",
      "sections": {
        "introduction": "The effects of microgravity and space-related radiation have the potential to impact astronaut health on long-duration missions. Indeed, human and animal model studies have already shown structural and/or functional deficits in the musculoskeletal system, the lymphatic and blood circulatory systems, and immune system after spaceflight [1–3]. Of particular concern is the impact of spaceflight on the cardiovascular system.",
        "methods": "Animal experiments were reviewed and approved by the NASA Flight Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (FIACUC) (protocol #RR-12). The experiments described here were a component of a larger investigation which was focused on the impact of immunization in the context of the spaceflight environment.",
        "results": "The transcriptomic changes induced in the heart following vaccination with tetanus toxoid plus the adjuvant CpG versus flight saline were identified using RNAseq (n = 3 per group) (Fig. 1a). The hearts of mice vaccinated in flight showed 658 upregulated and 472 downregulated transcripts (p < 0.01) when compared to flight saline mice (Fig. 1b).",
        "discussion": "In this study, we identified transcriptomic changes that occur in the mouse heart following immunization with TT + CpG in the spaceflight environment. A shift in cytokine expression and activation of the NF-κB pathway, leading to inflammation, occurred following vaccine administration."

      "abstract": "Disuse-induced bone loss is seen following spinal cord injury, prolonged bed rest, and exposure to microgravity. We performed whole transcriptomic profiling of cortical bone using RNA sequencing (RNAseq) and RNA molecular barcoding (NanoString) on a hindlimb unloading (HLU) mouse model to identify genes whose mRNA transcript abundances change in response to disuse.",
      "sections": {
        "introduction": "Mechanical loading plays an important role during musculoskeletal development and maintenance. Reduced mechanical loading from extended immobilization, spinal cord injury, or spaceflight leads to decreased bone mass and mineral density in humans, which increases susceptibility to skeletal fractures.",
        "methods": "Eleven-week old, female C57Bl/6J mice were randomly assigned to hindlimb unloading (HLU) or normal weightbearing (Cont) (n = 8/group). The HLU group underwent hindlimb unloading for 7 days according to the previously published studies [10–15].",
        "results": "Hindlimb unloading did not alter the quality of RNAseq data. For both groups, individual specimens yielded ~22 million reads with high unique mapping rates (79% for controls and 81% for HLU).",
        "discussion": "Our RNAseq dataset provides an unbiased approach for identifying genes whose transcripts change in response to mechanical unloading of cortical bone. We identified novel genes (e.g., Mss51, Pfkfb3) related to cell cycle, mitochondria, and cellular energy balance that were differentially regulated by HLU."

      "abstract": "Natural killer (NK) cells are an important first-line of defense against malignant cells. Because of the potential for increased cancer risk from astronaut exposure to space radiation, we determined whether microgravity present during spaceflight affects the body’s defenses against leukemogenesis.",
      "sections": {
        "introduction": "Natural killer (NK) cells are effector lymphocytes of the innate immune system that perform immunosurveillance and provide a first line of defense against virally-infected cells and cells that undergo malignant transformation, recognizing them and eliminating these aberrant clones, without the need for prior sensitization, before they can proliferate and give rise to disease1. In addition to mediating direct cytolysis of tumor cells, NK cells also serve as a critical bridge to the adaptive immune system, releasing cytokines such as IFN-γ, TNF-α, GM-CSF, and IL-33 and the chemokines MIP-1α, MIP-1β, and RANTES to recruit circulating T cells to the tumor site and stimulate T cell activation and proliferation to enhance the body’s immune response against neoplastic cell division or cancer development2,3. As such, any stressors that negatively affect the inherent anti-tumor properties of NK cells could directly increase the risk of carcinogenesis.",
        "methods": "The human natural killer cell line NK-92MI (ATCC® CRL™-2408) was used for initial cytotoxicity experiments. During expansion, cells were cultured in standard tissue culture flasks in Alpha Minimum Essential medium without ribonucleosides and deoxyribonucleosides but with 2 mM L-glutamine and 1.5 g/L sodium bicarbonate.",
        "results": "To begin to define the impact that exposure to microgravity has upon NK cell function, we incubated NK-92MI cells for 48 h in either: (1) conditions of normal gravity (1 G) in a standard culture T-flask; or (2) conditions of simulated microgravity (sμG) using the NASA-designed Synthecon rotating wall vessel (RWV) system and its associated high-aspect ratio vessels (HARVs).",
        "discussion": "Taken together, these data demonstrate that even fairly brief exposure to conditions of simulated microgravity (sμG) markedly reduces the cytotoxicity of both the NK-92MI cell lines and primary human NK cells from 3 different donors towards two different hematological tumor cell lines (K-562 and MOLT-4)."

Since astronauts may be exposed continually to a complex space radiation environment unlike that experienced on Earth, it is unresolved whether there is a risk to cardiovascular health during long-term space exploration missions.",
      "sections": {
        "introduction": "We recently reported on long term functional changes to the heart following a single dose of GCR5-ion (Bishawi et al., 2022). Physiologically, this dysfunction was manifested as changes in arterial elastance, and histologically, there was evidence of elastin fragmentation in the aorta.",
        "methods": "Approximately 24-week old male C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Labs) were exposed to 150 cGy GCR5-ion (H 1,000 MeV/n, 28Si 600 MeV/n, 4He 250 MeV/n, 16O 350 MeV/n, 56Fe 600 MeV/n, and H 250 MeV/n) using the beam line at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at BNL (Simonsen et al., 2020).",
        "results": "For the heart proteome, there were 87 significant DEPs (Supplementary Table S1); for the heart phosphoproteome, there were 60 significant differentially phosphorylated peptides (Supplementary Table S3); and for the plasma proteome, there was only one upregulated protein (Supplementary Table S2).",
        "discussion": "Based on data from epidemiological studies, it takes a significant amount of time for cardiovascular disease to develop (up to decades). There is relatively little knowledge regarding the time frame to develop cardiovascular disease from exposure to the space radiation environment."

      "abstract": "The vestibular system receives a permanent influence from gravity and reflexively controls equilibrium. If we assume gravity has remained constant during the species' evolution, will its sensory system adapt to abrupt loss of that force? We address this question in the land snail Helix lucorum exposed to 30 days of near weightlessness aboard the Bion-M1 satellite, and studied geotactic behavior of postflight snails, differential gene expressions in statocyst transcriptome, and electrophysiological responses of mechanoreceptors to applied tilts. Each approach revealed plastic changes in the snail's vestibular system assumed in response to spaceflight. Absence of light during the mission also affected statocyst physiology, as revealed by comparison to dark-conditioned control groups. Readaptation to normal tilt responses occurred at ~20 h following return to Earth. Despite the permanence of gravity, the snail responded in a compensatory manner to its loss and readapted once gravity was restored.",
      "sections": {
        "introduction": "Vertebrates and invertebrates sense inertial acceleration and a change in orientation with respect to gravity by mechanoreceptors in the otolith and statolith organs, respectively. The force of gravity is constantly present on Earth and forms the frame of reference for spatial orientation. Inertial accelerations occur within this gravity frame of reference naturally during self-generated movements or those imparted externally onto the organism by perturbations, such as a slippery surface or a deflected leaf. Kreidl (1893) demonstrated in a clever manner that the statocyst is a mechanosensitive organ. As a crayfish molts, it leaves behind the statolith and must manually re-seed its statocyst with a new, typically sand, weight-lending mass. Kreidl replaced the sand with reduced ferrous oxide and manipulated the crayfish's posture using a magnet, thereby simulating the action of the normal gravitational field with a magnetic one. Despite the simplicity of the gastropod organ of balance, there are many functional similarities between the snail's statocyst and the more highly evolved otolith organs of vertebrate species (Popova and Boyle, 2015). Statoreceptors, like hair cells in the vertebrate utricle and saccule, are mechanoreceptors that depend on a weight-lending mass to provide a shearing deformation of the underlying ciliary processes to sense position and acceleration with respect to gravity.",
        "methods": "The 2013 Bion-M1 space project was a 30-day orbital research mission operated by the Russian Academy of Sciences, launched on 19th of April (2013) from Baikonur Cosmodrome, Kazakhstan, and landed on 19th of May near Orenburg, Russia. The satellite was pressurized and contained full life support systems to maintain safe temperature, oxygen, and carbon dioxide levels for a wide variety of species. The satellite is under Earth's gravitational pull and is in a state of free fall or microgravity (μG), and thus the objects within the satellite appear to be weightless. Upon return to Earth, the snails were airlifted from the landing site by helicopter to the Orenburg airport, flown by airplane to Moscow, and transported by van to the laboratory, arriving within 13 h after landing.",
        "results": "When the platform upon which the snail is attached is suddenly pitched from horizontal to vertical, the snail displays a fear-like reaction by fully or partially withdrawing its tentacles (designed phase 0; Figure 1A). This reaction (latency of withdrawal is <1 s) is believed mediated by the gravi-sensing statocyst organ, the snail's equivalent to a vertebrate's vestibular otolith organ. Therefore, the differences in magnitude and time (duration) of the resulting tentacle elongation phase likely reveal changes in reaction of the snail's statocyst.",
        "discussion": "Upon entry into orbit the satellite is in a constant free fall back toward Earth and the traveler feels weightless. The neural gravity sensors that control normal balance and equilibrium are now forced to operate in a unique environment. The present experiments sought to identify the consequences of a 30-day orbital mission on the behavioral performance of snails challenged by a vestibular perturbation after return to normal 1G starting 14–15 h after landing."

      "abstract": "Xyloglucan is a polysaccharide that has important roles in the formation and function of the walls that surround growing land plant cells. Many of these plants synthesize xyloglucan that contains galactose in two different side chains (L and F), which exist in distinct molecular environments. However, little is known about the contribution of these side chains to xyloglucan function. Here, we show that Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) mutants devoid of the F side chain galactosyltransferase MURUS3 (MUR3) form xyloglucan that lacks F side chains and contains much less galactosylated xylose than its wild-type counterpart. The galactose-depleted xyloglucan is dysfunctional, as it leads to mutants that are dwarfed with curled rosette leaves, short petioles, and short inflorescence stems.",

      "abstract": "To overcome endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, ER-localized stress sensors actuate distinct downstream organelle-nucleus signaling pathways to invoke a cytoprotective response, known as the unfolded protein response (UPR). Compared to yeast and metazoans, plant UPR studies are more recent but nevertheless fascinating. Here we discuss recent discoveries in plant UPR, highlight conserved and unique features of the plant UPR as well as critical yet-open questions whose answers will likely make significant contributions to the understanding plant ER stress management.",
      "sections": {
        "introduction": "In growth and stress situations, cell homeostasis depends on the functional integrity of the major biosynthetic organelle, the ER, which synthesizes one third of the cellular proteome and essential lipids, and assembles complex-protein associated carbohydrates. When the cell's biosynthetic demands overcome the ER biosynthetic capacity, a potentially lethal condition, known as ER stress, is initiated. In multicellular eukaryotes if the UPR fails, ER stress-induced apoptosis occurs. Along eukaryotic lineages, specialized sensors have evolved to manage the UPR and control life-or-death outcomes in ER-stress conditions [1,2]. For ER-stress protection, yeast relies exclusively on the ER-associated ribonuclease and kinase IRE1. Plants and metazoans have evolved a complex signaling network based on membrane-tethered transcription factors (MTTFs) (Box 1), some of which are plant-specific (Figure 1). In metazoans, the ER-associated PERK also operates in UPR signaling (Box 1). Although PERK-like activity has been detected is plants [3], plant PERK-like proteins have not been identified yet (Box 1).",

By contrast, higher plant cells have discrete mobile Golgi stacks that move along the cortical ER, and the intermediate compartment is absent.",

      "abstract": "Photosynthesis occurs in mesophyll cells of specialized organs such as leaves. The rigid cell wall encapsulating photosynthetic cells controls the expansion and distribution of cells within photosynthetic tissues. The relationship between photosynthesis and plant growth is affected by leaf area. However, the underlying genetic mechanisms affecting carbon partitioning to different aspects of leaf growth are not known. To fill this gap, we analyzed Arabidopsis plants with altered levels of pectin methylesterification, which is known to modulate cell wall plasticity and plant growth. Pectin methylesterification levels were varied through manipulation of cotton Golgi-related (CGR) 2 or 3 genes encoding two functionally redundant pectin methyltransferases. Increased levels of methylesterification in a line over-expressing CGR2 (CGR2OX) resulted in highly expanded leaves with enhanced intercellular air spaces; reduced methylesterification in a mutant lacking both CGR-genes 2 and 3 (cgr2/3) resulted in thin but dense leaf mesophyll that limited CO2 diffusion to chloroplasts. Leaf, root, and plant dry weight were enhanced in CGR2OX but decreased in cgr2/3. Differences in growth between wild type and the CGR-mutants can be explained by carbon partitioning but not by variations in area-based photosynthesis. Therefore, photosynthesis drives growth through alterations in carbon partitioning to new leaf area growth and leaf mass per unit leaf area; however, CGR-mediated pectin methylesterification acts as a primary factor in this relationship through modulation of the expansion and positioning of the cells in leaves, which in turn drive carbon partitioning by generating dynamic carbon demands in leaf area growth and leaf mass per unit leaf area.",

      "abstract": "Eukaryotic cells require mechanisms to establish the proportion of cellular volume devoted to particular organelles. These mechanisms are poorly understood. From a screen for plastid-to-nucleus signaling mutants in Arabidopsis thaliana, we cloned a mutant allele of a gene that encodes a protein of unknown function that is homologous to two other Arabidopsis genes of unknown function and to FRIENDLY, which was previously shown to promote the normal distribution of mitochondria in Arabidopsis. In contrast to FRIENDLY, these three homologs of FRIENDLY are found only in photosynthetic organisms. Based on these data, we proposed that FRIENDLY expanded into a small gene family to help regulate the energy metabolism of cells that contain both mitochondria and chloroplasts. Indeed, we found that knocking out these genes caused a number of chloroplast phenotypes, including a reduction in the proportion of cellular volume devoted to chloroplasts to 50% of wild type. Thus, we refer to these genes as REDUCED CHLOROPLAST COVERAGE (REC). The size of the chloroplast compartment was reduced most in rec1 mutants. The REC1 protein accumulated in the cytosol and the nucleus. REC1 was excluded from the nucleus when plants were treated with amitrole, which inhibits cell expansion and chloroplast function. We conclude that REC1 is an extraplastidic protein that helps to establish the size of the chloroplast compartment, and that signals derived from cell expansion or chloroplasts may regulate REC1.",
      "sections": {
        "introduction": "Mechanisms that determine the cellular volume allocated to organelles are largely unknown. We demonstrate that in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, a small gene family that encodes proteins of unknown function contributes to a mechanism that establishes the proportion of cellular volume devoted to chloroplasts. We show that this mechanism resides outside of the chloroplast by demonstrating that the protein that makes the greatest contribution to this mechanism resides in the cytoplasm and nucleus and that the trafficking of this protein between the cytoplasm and nucleus may regulate this mechanism. A deeper understanding of this mechanism may lead to the rational manipulation of chloroplast compartment size, which may lead to more efficient photosynthesis and increased yields from important crop plants.",
        "methods": "Detailed information on the materials and methods used in this study is provided in SI Appendix.",
        "results": "We obtained one mutant allele of REC1 that we named rec1-1 from a screen for genomes uncoupled (gun) mutants (12). gun alleles disrupt the plastid-to-nucleus signaling that down-regulates photosynthesis-associated nuclear gene (PhANG) expression when chloroplast biogenesis is blocked. Thus, gun mutants express higher levels of PhANGs than wild type when chloroplast biogenesis is blocked (8). In addition to a gun phenotype, rec1-1 greens after seedlings are grown in far-red light and then transferred to white light (Fig. 1A and SI Appendix, Fig. S1A). When wild-type seedlings are grown in far-red light, they overaccumulate the chlorophyll precursor protochlorophyllide. In white light, these elevated levels of protochlorophyllide block chloroplast biogenesis by inducing increases in the levels of singlet oxygen (14, 15). We mapped this greening phenotype to a 70-kb interval near the top of chromosome 1 (SI Appendix, Fig. S1B). We sequenced seven genes in this interval. We found a C-to-T transition that causes a nonsense mutation in the codon that encodes Q1415 of At1g01320 (SI Appendix, Fig. S1 C and D). At1g01320 encodes a protein of unknown function with a calculated mass of 200 kDa. This protein contains three tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs) and 106 residues near the carboxyl terminus that are 29% proline (SI Appendix, Fig. S1D). TPRs contribute to the protein–protein interactions that underpin diverse biological processes (16).",
        "discussion": "Our phenotypic characterizations provide evidence that the proteins encoded by the REC gene family link increases in mesophyll cell size to increases in chloroplast compartment size. Other than the proteins encoded by the REC gene family, there are no candidates for proteins that contribute to this mechanism (2, 6, 45)."

        "introduction": "As the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the entry point to secretory pathway (Vitale and Denecke 1999), the primary site of phospholipid synthesis (Ohlrogge and Browse 1995), a hub for critical stress and growth signaling molecules (Light et al. 2016, Ron and Walter 2007, Shore et al. 2011), and the assembly plant for a third of a cell's total proteome (Wallin and Heijne 1998), interruptions in its functions can have vast consequences in cellular health. Under physiological conditions of growth, a dedicated battery of ER-resident proteins can prevent misfolding of nascent polypeptides and facilitate acquisition of the proper tertiary structure through post-translational modification (e.g., covalent addition of oligosaccharide chains or catalysis of disulfide bond formation) (Dobson 2003, Gupta and Tuteja 2011). In plants affected by environmental stress (e.g. heat stress (Gidalevitz et al. 2011)), proper folding of secretory proteins can be impaired and misfolded proteins can accumulate in the ER igniting a potentially lethal condition known as ER stress (Dobson 2003, Hartl and Haver-Hartl 2009, Buchberger et al 2010). Indeed, under prolonged or severe levels of stress, the accumulation and aggregation of unfolded proteins can become cytotoxic and lead to death of the plant cell in a manner akin to the effect of misfolded proteins that aggregate and cause human neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's (Hoozemans et al. 2005). The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a set of signaling mechanisms designed to prevent accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER. Specialized ER-localized membrane proteins are able to detect the buildup of unfolded proteins and activate signaling cascades that modulate the abundance of the proteins dedicated to the folding of nascent polypeptides within the ER to maintain homeostasis (Ron and Walter 2007, Ruberti and Brandizzi 2014, Ruberti et al. 2015).

      "abstract": "Plants are primary producers of food and oxygen on Earth and will likewise be indispensable to the establishment of large-scale sustainable ecosystems and human survival in space. To contribute to the understanding of how plants respond to spaceflight stress, we examined the significance of the unfolded protein response (UPR), a conserved signaling cascade that responds to a number of unfavorable environmental stresses, in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana.",
      "sections": {
        "introduction": "Extraterrestrial habitation and prolonged space travel require successful plant growth to recreate livable environments for humans (Ferl et al., 2002; Massa et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2019). Studies over the past 70 years have sought to develop a better understanding of how plants are affected by and adapt to the significant stresses imposed by spaceflight (e.g., microgravity, radiation, vibration, limited exchange of gases), which can affect plant development and yield (Paul et al., 2013).",
        "methods": "This flight experiment utilized 4 Biological Research In a Canister (BRIC) containing a total of 22 Petri Dish Fixation Unit (PDFU) hardware (Wells et al., 2001) to cultivate sterile dark-grown seedlings germinated aboard the ISS for a 14 day period.",
        "results": "When we inspected the WT and UPR-mutant seedlings (atire1, bzip60, bzip28, and bzip28 bzip60) of the ground control and flight samples at the completion of the mission, we found that in the ground control samples, etiolated hypocotyls (i.e., pale and elongated due to the lack of light) were above the surface of the solidified media while roots had penetrated the growth medium perpendicular to the surface (Fig. 1A).",
        "discussion": "In this study, we examined the transcriptional responses of WT and seedlings with a compromised UPR to spaceflight to set the foundations to manipulate a critical growth and stress signaling pathway for improving plant adaptation to extraterrestrial environments."

        "introduction": "From the first manned flight into space to sending humans to the surface of the moon, we have gained a better appreciation and understanding of the complexities of space travel. Now in the 21st century, current efforts are aimed at a return to the moon, largely in part as preparation for longer duration missions that take humans to Mars for the first time. However, as space exploration advances into new environmental domains, the complications with basic human survival and physiology become even more evident. NASA has identified several hazards of human spaceflight including space radiation, isolation and confinement, distance from earth (and its technological hurdles), exposure to extreme temperatures, pressures, and microgravity.1 As humans and other mammals have evolved with Earth’s natural gravity, exposure to microgravity with spaceflight can lead to many maladaptive changes, one in particular being a decline in musculoskeletal health and function. The absence of gravity unloads muscles and bones, leading to a reduction in size and strength - akin to aging on Earth. As a result, Space Agencies across the world have focused their attention on developing mitigation strategies to protect musculoskeletal health during space travel, not only to preserve astronaut health and the mission at hand, but also in hopes of developing novel and innovative strategies that may counter aging on Earth.",
        "methods": "Soleus, EDL, and TA muscle samples were obtained from the BION-M1 mission as well as the RR1, RR9, and RR18 missions through the NASA Life Sciences Data Archive Institutional Scientific Collection Biospecimen Sharing Program. For all missions, we were provided with 3 experimental groups: 1) Flight (F) group housed in specialized mission hardware; 2) Ground control (GC) housed in specialized mission hardware here on Earth; and 3) Vivarium (VIV) control housed in standard laboratory cages and conditions.",
        "results": "We first characterized the effects of spaceflight on GSK3 content and activation, and although there was no effect of spaceflight in the EDL or TA, we found significant differences in the soleus - a postural muscle that is most affected by microgravity exposure (Figures S1–S7). To summarize the soleus data, we examined the fold-change response in the F group relative to the combined average of the GC and VIV control groups, as no differences were detected between the GC and VIV groups (Figure 1). Across all missions, we observed significant reductions in total GSK3β content (-22-54%) compared with GCVIV control with a combined reduction of 36% (Figure 1A).",
        "discussion": "Here, we questioned whether GSK3 would be a viable therapeutic target that when inhibited could prevent or limit the muscle and bone loss associated with spaceflight. To this end, we first examined the effects of at least 30 days of spaceflight on GSK3 content and activation status in murine muscle and bone samples. We then supplemented this work with Earth-based HLS experiments in GSK3mKD mice where we assessed muscle size and strength with region-specific BMD."

      "abstract": "The heart and its cellular components are profoundly altered by missions to space and injury on Earth. Further research, however, is needed to characterize and address the molecular substrates of such changes. For this reason, neonatal and adult human cardiovascular progenitor cells (CPCs) were cultured aboard the International Space Station. Upon return to Earth, we measured changes in the expression of microRNAs and of genes related to mechanotransduction, cardiogenesis, cell cycling, DNA repair, and paracrine signaling. We additionally assessed endothelial-like tube formation, cell cycling, and migratory capacity of CPCs. Changes in microRNA expression were predicted to target extracellular matrix interactions and Hippo signaling in both neonatal and adult CPCs. Genes related to mechanotransduction (YAP1, RHOA) were downregulated, while the expression of cytoskeletal genes (VIM, NES, DES, LMNB2, LMNA), non-canonical Wnt ligands (WNT5A, WNT9A), and Wnt/calcium signaling molecules (PLCG1, PRKCA) was significantly elevated in neonatal CPCs. Increased mesendodermal gene expression along with decreased expression of mesodermal derivative markers (TNNT2, VWF, and RUNX2), reduced readiness to form endothelial-like tubes, and elevated expression of Bmp and Tbx genes, were observed in neonatal CPCs. Both neonatal and adult CPCs exhibited increased expression of DNA repair genes and paracrine factors, which was supported by enhanced migration. While spaceflight affects cytoskeletal organization and migration in neonatal and adult CPCs, only neonatal CPCs experienced increased expression of early developmental markers and an enhanced proliferative potential. Efforts to recapitulate the effects of spaceflight on Earth by regulating processes described herein may be a promising avenue for cardiac repair.",
      "sections": {
        "introduction": "Changes to the cardiovascular system during spaceflight have prompted molecular biologists to understand the mechanisms governing cellular adaptation to culture aboard the International Space Station (ISS). In doing so, researchers have begun to identify therapeutic benefits, such as enhanced stemness, following culture in space and under conditions that approximate weightlessness on Earth. Therefore, increased understanding of the response of cardiovascular progenitor cells (CPCs) to spaceflight may not only benefit human health in space, but also provide insights into novel cardiovascular stem cell therapies that can be applied on Earth.",
        "methods": "CPCs were isolated from cardiac tissue of neonatal (1 day–1 month) or adult (57–72 year old) human patients, as previously described. The methods were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations and were approved by the Institutional Review Board of Loma Linda University for the use of discarded tissue without identifiable private information under a waiver of informed consent.",
        "results": "CPCs were clonally isolated, expanded, screened for the co-expression of Isl1 and c-Kit, assessed for viability, and ultimately selected for experiments based upon the expression of early developmental markers (Mesp1, PDGFRα, and SSEA1) along with the chemokine receptor CXCR4. Representative adult and neonatal clones are shown in Fig. 1a and Fig S1. Neonatal and adult CPCs are able to differentiate into cardiomyocytes (Fig. 1b), endothelial cells (Fig. 1c), and smooth muscle cells (Fig. 1d) when cultured using directed differentiation protocols (Fig. S2).",
        "discussion": "In this study, we found that spaceflight exerts broad effects on the developmental status, proliferative potential, and migratory ability of CPCs, some of which occurred in an age-dependent manner. In particular, neonatal CPCs exhibited increased expression of early developmental markers, enhanced proliferative potential, and increased migratory capacity following culture aboard the ISS. Meanwhile, adult CPCs experienced little change in the expression of genes indicative of their developmental state, but exhibited changes to migratory capacity."

      "abstract": "Metabolic and immune mediators activate many of the same signal transduction pathways. Therefore, molecules that regulate metabolism often affect immune responses. Leptin is an adipokine that exemplifies this interplay. Leptin is the body’s major nutritional status sensor, but it also plays a key role in immune system regulation. To provide an in vitro tool to investigate the link between leptin and innate immunity, we immortalized and characterized a leptin receptor-deficient macrophage cell line, DB-1. The cell line was created using bone marrow cells from leptin receptor-deficient mice. Bone marrow cells were differentiated into macrophages by culturing them with recombinant mouse macrophage colony stimulating factor, and passaged when confluent for 6 months. The cells spontaneously immortalized at approximately passage 20. Cells were cloned twice by limiting dilution cloning prior to characterization. The macrophage cell line is diploid and grows at a linear rate for 4–5 days before reaching the growth plateau. The cells are MAC-2 and F4/80 positive and have phagocytic activity similar to primary macrophages from wild-type and leptin receptor-deficient mice. DB-1 cells were responsive to stimulation with interferon-γ as measured by increase in Nos2 transcript levels. In addition, DB-1 macrophages are not responsive to the chemotactic signaling of adipocyte conditioned media nor leptin when compared to primary WT macrophages. We believe that DB-1 cells provide a dependable tool to study the role of leptin or the leptin receptor in obesity-associated inflammation and immune system dysregulation.",
      "sections": {
        "introduction": "Leptin, the product of the ob gene, is a 16 kDa peptide hormone predominantly secreted by white adipocytes (Ahima and Flier 2000; Zhang et al. 1994). Leptin is structurally similar to type I cytokines and referred to as an adipokine or adipocytokine (Otero et al. 2005). Leptin signals through its receptor (LepR) encoded by the Lepr gene (Chen et al. 1996). The LepR exists in six alternatively spliced isoforms (Lee et al. 1996). The long isoform of LepR is a member of the interleukin-6 receptor family of class 1 cytokine receptors, and is responsible for most of leptin’s physiological activities (Baumann et al. 1996; Tartaglia et al. 1995).",
        "methods": "Male leptin receptor-deficient (db/db) mice as well as gender- and aged-matched wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 mice controls were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). All animal procedures were performed with prior approval and regular monitoring of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Kansas State University.",
        "results": "We established an immortal leptin receptor-deficient cell line from mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages. Bone marrow cells from leptin receptor deficient mice (db/db) were collected and cultured in biomedium as described in the Materials and Methods section. Differentiated macrophages were passaged at confluency. Cells were kept in biomedium for 6 months when the cells appeared to grow at a stable rate after twenty passages. At that time, we did two consecutive limiting dilution cloning procedures. The DB-1 cells were selected from cloned cells from the second cloning. DB-1 cells lost their dependency to M-CSF during the cloning process. They were propagated and shifted to a regular medium, DMEM supplemented with 2 % Nu serum and 2 % FBS. DB-1 cells exhibit morphological properties characteristic of macrophages, and are adherent with multiple processes (Fig. 1).",
        "discussion": "We created a leptin-receptor deficient cell line, DB-1, that has some phenotypic and functional properties characteristic of primary macrophages. It is diploid, has the normal complement of chromosomes, lacks the long isoform of the leptin receptor, and is unresponsive to leptin."

      "abstract": "Spaceflight is known to affect immune cell populations. In particular, splenic B cell numbers decrease during spaceflight and in ground-based physiological models. Although antibody isotype changes have been assessed during and after space flight, an extensive characterization of the impact of spaceflight on antibody composition has not been conducted in mice. Next Generation Sequencing and bioinformatic tools are now available to assess antibody repertoires. We can now identify immunoglobulin gene-segment usage, junctional regions, and modifications that contribute to specificity and diversity.",

        "introduction": "For B cell development and specificity, there are a large number of heavy chain (IgH) and kappa light chain (Igκ) gene segments that are used to produce the Ig (antibody) receptor population repertoire (de Bono et al., 2004). This antibody repertoire is quite large and the possible specificities can theoretically exceed the number of actual antibody molecules in the host (Georgiou et al., 2014).",

        "introduction": "Hemophilia A is a monogenic X chromosome-linked inherited bleeding disorder caused by mutations in the F8 gene encoding blood clotting factor VIII (FVIII), leading to the loss of functional FVIII protein.",
        "methods": "For candidate screening, codon-optimized cDNAs encoding the amino acid sequence identical to recombinant FVIII moroctocog alfa-type BDD-FVIII31 were used to generate AAV expression cassettes that were composed of flanking AAV2-derived ITRs, a liver-specific TTR promoter/enhancer,60 the respective BDD-F8 transgene, and a synthetic polyadenylation site.",
        "results": "Expression levels of endogenous wild-type (WT) FVIII levels are relatively low,23 and the corresponding coding region exceeds the natural packaging limit for AAV.",
        "discussion": "Here, we describe preclinical development of TAK-754, an efficient human AAV vector for gene therapy in patients with hemophilia A, designed to express a human BDD-FVIII protein with an identical amino acid sequence to that of recombinant FVIII moroctocog alfa."
