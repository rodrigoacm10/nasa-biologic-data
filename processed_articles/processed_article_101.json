    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Spaceflight microgravity is known to impact numerous physiological systems. These include cardiovascular changes, decreased bone mineral density, loss of muscle tone, adipogenesis, insulin resistance, vision and vestibular disturbances, altered fluid and electrolyte balance, and altered kidney function to name a few1. Many, if not all, normal homeostatic processes occurring within mammals, both male and female, are dramatically impacted by gonadal hormones.",
      "methods": "Forty 12-week old C57BI/6J female mice (Jackson Lab, Bar Harbor, ME) were selected based on similar body weights for 4 experimental groups (16-week old at launch, n = 10/group): baseline control, vivarium control, habitat control, and flight.",
      "results": "Estrous cycle stage for each mouse was determined by three independent investigators blinded to treatment group categories.",
      "discussion": "Our results provide detailed consequences of long-term spaceflight microgravity on rodent estrous cycle, ovarian steroidogenesis, and gene expression."
