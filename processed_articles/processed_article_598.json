    "abstract": "UNC-89 is a giant sarcomeric M-line protein required for sarcomere organization and optimal muscle function. UNC-89 contains two protein kinase domains, PK1 and PK2, separated by an elastic region. Here we show that PK2 is a canonical kinase expected to be catalytically active.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Muscle sarcomeres contain extraordinarily large proteins, >700,000â€‰Da1. Examples include twitchin, UNC-89, and TTN-1 in C. elegans2; projectin, obscurin, and Sallimus in Drosophila3, and titin and obscurin in vertebrates4,5.",
      "methods": "Three-dimensional structural models of UNC-89-PK2 (UniProtKB O01761) were calculated using AlphaFold v2.3.168 as implemented in the ColabFold 1.5.5 server (https://colab.research.google.com/github/sokrypton/ColabFold/blob/main/AlphaFold2.ipynb).",
      "results": "A sequence analysis of PK2 from C. elegans UNC-89 using BLAST confirmed that it belongs to the DMT class of CAMK kinases (Ca2+/Calmodulin-dependent kinases).",
      "discussion": "We first performed bioinformatics analysis indicating that UNC-89 PK2 is a canonical active protein kinase and that a particular missense mutation (KtoA) is expected to abolish activity but not the stability of the protein."
