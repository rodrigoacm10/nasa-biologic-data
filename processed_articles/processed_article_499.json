    "abstract": "Living longer without simultaneously extending years spent in good health (“health span”) is an increasing societal burden, demanding new therapeutic strategies. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) can correct disease-related mitochondrial metabolic deficiencies, and supraphysiological H2S concentrations can pro health span. However, the efficacy and mechanisms of mitochondrion-targeted sulfide delivery molecules (mtH2S) administered across the adult life course are unknown.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Deteriorating health across the life course is a major societal burden, and effective therapeutics are lacking. Mitochondrial decline has long been associated with age-related health loss.",
      "methods": "The strains used in this study were N2 wild-type and CB5600 (ccIs4251 (Pmyo-3::Ngfp-lacZ; Pmyo-3::Mtgfp)) and were obtained from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Centre (CGC, University of Minnesota).",
      "results": "We first investigated the effects of mitochondrion-targeted and nontargeted H2S donors on C. elegans life span. Dosing L1 larvae with the untargeted sulfide donor NaGYY4137 (100 µM) increased maximal life span by 20 % (P < 0.0001) (Fig. 1A), which is comparable to previous studies using GYY4137 (morpholine salt) and related compounds (18, 19).",
      "discussion": "H2S is a diatomic signaling molecule that promotes healthy aging in C. elegans (20), yet the underlying mechanisms and therapeutic viability across the lifecourse remains unclear."
