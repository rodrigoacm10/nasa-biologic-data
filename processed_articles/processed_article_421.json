    "abstract": "DNA methylation (addition of methyl groups to cytosines) and changes in telomere length (TTAGGG repeats on the ends of chromosomes) are two molecular modifications that result from stress and could contribute to the long-term effects of intrauterine exposure to maternal stress on offspring behavior.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Perturbations during gestation in the form of malnutrition, infection, or psychosocial stress have devastating consequences on the physical and mental well-being of offspring.",
      "methods": "Female Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats and their offspring were used (n=6 control animals per sex, 7 UVPS animals per sex derived from 13 dams, with only one male and one female offspring from each control and UVPS litter).",
      "results": "UVPS males had higher levels of methylation in the mPFC (Figure 1A).",
      "discussion": "Here we used a rodent model of unpredictable, variable prenatal stress to test the hypothesis that a stressful environment in utero can render epigenetic and telomeric changes in the brain of offspring."
