    "abstract": "Low bone mass is often associated with elevated bone marrow adiposity. Since osteoblasts and adipocytes are derived from the same mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) progenitor, adipocyte formation may increase at the expense of osteoblast formation. Leptin is an adipocyte-derived hormone known to regulate energy and bone metabolism.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Adipose tissue in bone marrow may contribute to metabolic health through its effects on local energy balance and/or its actions as an endocrine organ (1). Low bone mass is often associated with elevated bone marrow adiposity (2, 3). Bone marrow contains mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) capable of differentiating into cells of the osteoblastic and adipocytic lineages (4).",
      "methods": "Eight- to 10-week-old male WT C57BL/6J (B6) and leptin-deficient ob/ob mice on the same genetic background were obtained from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA).",
      "results": "The effects of treatment on body weight and on cancellous bone in the distal femur metaphysis are shown in Table 1. rAAV-Lep treatment resulted in lower body weight compared to untreated, rAAV-GFP-treated, and pair-fed mice.",
      "discussion": "Leptin-deficient ob/ob mice were heavier and had increased MAT in distal femur metaphysis compared to WT mice. Consumption of high-fat diet resulted in increased body weight in both WT mice and ob/ob mice but increased MAT and cancellous bone in WT mice only."
