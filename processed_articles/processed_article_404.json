    "abstract": "Although many reports characterize the transcriptional response of Arabidopsis seedlings to microgravity, few investigate the effect of partial or fractional gravity on gene expression.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Plant cultivation will be essential during long duration space missions to supplement nutritional needs of the crew, purify air and water, and provide psychological benefits to the crew [1].",
      "methods": "The plant signaling experiment was carried out in the EMCS using the TROPI-like seed cassettes previously described [20].",
      "results": "When the fractional g gradient across the samples in the actively spinning rotor is considered, 101 genes exhibited dose-associated expression levels that occurred in one of three different patterns of expression:",
      "discussion": "Our results also highlight that plant defense responses may be compromised in space, an unwelcome hazard that might be exacerbated if plant pathogens develop increased virulence in space as has been shown [74]."
