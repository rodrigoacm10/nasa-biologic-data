    "abstract": "Whole-genome sequences were generated from 96 bacterial strains of 14 species that were isolated from International Space Station surfaces during the Microbial Tracking 2 study. Continued characterization of this closed habitat's microbiome enables tracking of the spread and evolution of secondary pathogens, which is vital for astronaut health.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "The International Space Station (ISS) is currently the only long-term human habitat in space. Microgravity disrupts human immune function (1), and close monitoring of the ISS microbiome for increased pathogenicity is thus an ongoing critical task.",
      "methods": "Accession numbers, sampling locations, and assembly details for bacterial strains isolated from the ISS",
      "results": "Four species from the phylum Actinobacteria were isolated, from the genera Pseudoclavibacter, Kocuria, and Micrococcus, all of which are common in both environmental and human microbiomes (2–5).",
      "discussion": "Multiple coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) were also isolated. CoNS are normal components of human skin flora (9) and are often resistant to antibiotics because of their ability to form biofilms (10); all CoNS in this report are documented opportunistic pathogens (11–15)."
