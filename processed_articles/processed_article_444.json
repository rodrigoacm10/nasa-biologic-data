    "abstract": "Platelets (PLTs) are anucleate and considered incapable of nuclear functions. Contrastingly, nuclear proteins were detected in human PLTs. For most of these proteins, it is unclear if nuclear or alternatively assigned functions are performed, a question we wanted to address for nuclear assembly protein 1 like 1 (NAP1L1).",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Megakaryocytes (MKs) are highly specialized precursor cells, residing in the bone marrow [1] and lungs [2], that produce and finally release platelets (PLTs) [3,4,5].",
      "methods": "The following reagents and antibodies were used for microscopy, Western blot, and co-IP studies as described below: Paraformaldehyde (PFA 4% [2% final]), Alexa Fluor 555 conjugate of wheat germ agglutinin (WGA, 1:1000; Thermo Fisher Scientific, W32464),",
      "results": "We initially sought to determine RNA expression patterns of NAP1L1 in CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cell-derived MKs and freshly isolated human PLTs. Next generation RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed that MKs and human PLTs express messenger RNA (mRNA) for NAP1L1 (Figure 1A,B).",
      "discussion": "The MK-PLT axis is increasingly recognized as being more intricate and sophisticated in cellular responsibilities and abilities than historically expected."
