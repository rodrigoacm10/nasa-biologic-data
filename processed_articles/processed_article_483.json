    "abstract": "Mice are typically housed at temperatures well below their thermoneutral zone. When individually housed at room temperature (~22 °C) mice experience cold stress which results in cancellous bone loss and has the potential to alter the skeletal response to treatment.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Mice are a commonly used model organism for studying how factors, such as physical activity, influence aging-related bone loss. Mice are typically maintained at housing temperatures of 20–26 °C (National Research Council (US) Committee for the Update of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, 2011).",
      "methods": "Experimental protocols were approved by the Oregon State University Animal Care and Use Committee and mice were maintained in accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and the Use of Laboratory Animals.",
      "results": "Mice individually housed at 26 °C consumed less food than mice individually housed at 22 °C (Panel a) at all time points assayed.",
      "discussion": "Body weight, lean mass, fat mass, femur size, BMC and BMD, and cancellous bone volume fraction in lumbar and caudal vertebrae increased from 6 to 18 weeks of age in female B6 mice housed at room temperature (22 °C)."
