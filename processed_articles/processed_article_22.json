      "introduction": "Over the last decade the vast increase in outputs from “omics” (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) assays, together with decreasing assay and data storage costs, have resulted in an exponentially increasing volume of these “big” data.",

      "discussion": "The systems we assessed for FAIRness clearly have shortcomings, particularly in the area of supporting data interoperability."
