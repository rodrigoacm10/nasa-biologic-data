    "abstract": "Ground‐based animal models have been used extensively to understand the effects of microgravity on various physiological systems. Among them, hindlimb suspension (HLS), developed in 1979 in rats, remains the gold‐standard and allows researchers to study the consequences of total unloading of the hind limbs while inducing a cephalic fluid shift.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Long duration spaceflight has been well established to produce substantial muscle loss and reduced functional capability.",
      "methods": "Twenty‐eight Wistar rats (14 males and 14 females, 14‐weeks old at baseline) were obtained (Charles River Laboratories) and housed separately in a temperature‐controlled room (22 ± 2℃) with a 12:12h light‐dark cycle starting at 7:00 AM.",
      "results": "NL animals’ weight increased over the 14‐day period, while HLS rats’ weight decreased (effect of loading: p = 0.0031, effect of time × loading: p < 0.0001, Figure 1a).",
      "discussion": "We studied the effects of 14 days of HLS in adult male and female rats. Exposure to HLS elicited a significant decline in grip strength, muscle mass, and myofiber cross‐section area (CSA) in all animals;"
