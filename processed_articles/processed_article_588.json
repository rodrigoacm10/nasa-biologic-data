      "introduction": "The Gowanus Canal in Brooklyn, NY, USA is an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Superfund site (Miller 2015) which contains significant amounts of chemicals of concern (Mandigo et al. 2016).",
      "methods": "Sediment sampling was performed across fourteen sites along the length (2.9 km) of the Canal (numbered 01–14 in Fig. 1).",
      "results": "Species abundance was computed for all the samples. Kendall correlation (Fig. S1) shows groupings of Gowanus samples into two broad sets, the Core Samples and the Sediment Samples.",
      "discussion": "Collectively, the microbiome of the canal encodes a wide range of antimicrobial resistance genes, including some related to human pharmaceutical use."
