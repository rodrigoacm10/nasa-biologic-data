    "abstract": "A plant’s oxygen supply can vary from normal (normoxia) to total depletion (anoxia). Tolerance to anoxia is relevant to wetland species, rice (Oryza sativa) cultivation, and submergence tolerance of crops. Decoding and transmitting calcium (Ca) signals may be an important component to anoxia tolerance; however, the contribution of intracellular Ca transporters to this process is poorly understood.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Plants are frequently exposed to limited oxygen availability, influencing plant growth and, in an agricultural context, plant productivity (Loreti et al., 2016; Pedersen et al., 2017; Schmidt et al., 2018). The lack of oxygen (anoxia) reduces plant energy production (Rawyler et al., 2002).",
      "methods": "Arabidopsis seeds were sterilized in 20% bleach (v/v) for 15 min before they were planted on 1/2X Murashige and Skoog (MS) media containing 0.8% agar (w/v) and 0.5% sucrose (w/v), and were grown under equal day/night light conditions (12-h light, 22°C, 180 μmol·m−2·s −1, and 12-h night 20°C).",
      "results": "We sought to clarify the role of CAX genes in anoxia tolerance using a seedling survival assay where plants are exposed to anoxic conditions for a period of time and survival monitored upon return to normoxic conditions (ambient air, i.e. ∼21% O2).",
      "discussion": "Hypoxia exerts a negative impact on energy production (Atwell et al., 2015). Hypoxic events can be viewed as a sequential, compound stress, where both the lack of oxygen and the reoxygenation periods pose distinct stressors;"
