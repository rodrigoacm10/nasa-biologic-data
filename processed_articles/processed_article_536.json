    "abstract": "Nineteen strains from the order Lactobacillales were isolated from the International Space Station and commercial resupply vehicle, and whole-genome sequences (WGS) were generated.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "The order Lactobacillales consists of Gram stain-positive, facultative anaerobes validly described by Ludwig et al. (1). Members of the genus Enterococcus are found to possess human pathogenicity characteristics such as antibiotic resistance (2) and therefore pose health concerns for those on Earth and astronauts residing in the International Space Station (ISS).",
      "methods": "The strains used for the WGS were collected from three different ISS locations across two flights and seven different surface locations, including one field control on CRV6, and are detailed in TableÂ 1 (7).",

      "discussion": "Understanding the genomic makeup of these potential pathogens will help the development of suitable countermeasure and mitigation strategies."
