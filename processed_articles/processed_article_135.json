    "abstract": "The primary energy sources of mammalian cells are proteins, fats and sugars that are processed by well-known biochemical mechanisms that have been discovered and studied in 1G (terrestrial gravity). Here we sought to determine how simulated microgravity (sim-μG) impacts both energy and lipid metabolism in oligodendrocytes (OLs), the myelin forming cells in the central nervous system.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "The central nervous system of all animal species has evolved in a one-G or terrestrial gravity (1G) environment and is functionally influenced by its presence.",
      "methods": "Human tissue experiments were approved by the Office of the Human Subject Committee.",
      "results": "Human OLs were grown in OSM for four days in 1G or sim-μG.",
      "discussion": "Microgravity has been shown to cause cell damage and impair the cell cycle in a variety of biological systems including transiently in neural stem cells."
