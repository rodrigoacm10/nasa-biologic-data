    "abstract": "Black fungi are a group of melanotic microfungi characterized by remarkable polyextremotolerance. Due to a broad ecological plasticity and adaptations at the cellular level, it is predicted that they may survive in a variety of extreme environments, including harsh niches on Earth and Mars, and in outer space.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Microbial extremophiles are of great interest to studies aiming to elucidate stress adaptation and survival mechanisms. Successful examples of extremophiles can be found in the fungal domain, alongside bacteria, and archaea, which for a long time were considered to be the sole colonizers of habitats previously considered uninhabitable.",
      "methods": "Fungal cultures were maintained in flasks containing 50 mL of 2% malt extract broth (MEB, pH 5, 2% malt extract, 2% glucose, 1% peptone) at 21°C with shaking at 63 rpm (Innova, Eppendorf).",
      "results": "Cell concentration in the LSSMG-exposed and unexposed samples was measured via hemocytometer at four different time points: (1) start (seed, day 0), (2) acceleration phase (in between lag and exponential phases, day 3), (3) exponential phase (day 5) and (4) at the end of the experiment (stationary phase, day 7).",
      "discussion": "To date, investigations into the responses of microorganisms to space and Mars-like conditions have been performed with few black fungi species; some of them involved stress simulation in ground-based facilities (Pacelli et al., 2017), while others carried out the exposure of fungal strains inside or outside the International Space Station (Onofri et al., 2012, 2019; Pacelli et al., 2016)."
