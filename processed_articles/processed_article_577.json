      "introduction": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important opportunistic human pathogen, capable of thriving in different environmental niches. Activation of the AlgU-regulated extracytoplasmic stress response results in the production of copious amounts of an exopolysaccharide called alginate, forming a capsule that protects the bacterium from the host-immune system.",
      "methods": "Transposon mutagenesis was carried out via biparental conjugations using E. coli SM10 λpir carrying plasmid pFAC as the donor strain (Wong and Mekalanos, 2000) and PAO1 as the recipient strain.",
      "results": "Alginate production by PAO1-VE22 (31 ± 1.5 μg/ml/OD600) was substantially higher than that of PAO1 (8.5 ± 0.02 μg/ml/OD600) after 24 h growth at 37°C.",
      "discussion": "We found that expression of HA-CupB51–491-H6 in PAO1 increased alginate production in vivo and demonstrated that a GYYYTVV peptide (corresponding to CupB5 residues 485–491) antagonized MucB inhibition in vitro."
