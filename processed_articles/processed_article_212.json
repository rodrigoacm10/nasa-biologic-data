      "introduction": "On Earth, the lumbar spine bears the load of the upper body in upright posture and is stabilized by both passive and active systems [1].",
      "methods": "With institutional research board approval, spine imaging and health data were assessed from six NASA astronaut crewmembers at two time points: before launch (“pre”) and 1 day following 6 months’ spaceflight on the ISS (“post”).",
      "results": "Following spaceflight, lumbar lordosis decreased (flattened) in all six subjects (average change: −11.1%, p=.009; Table).",
      "discussion": "This unique longitudinal study underscores the coupled role of passive and active spine stabilizers in maintaining lumbar spine health."
