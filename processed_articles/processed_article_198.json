    "abstract": "Leptopilina heterotoma are obligate parasitoid wasps that develop in the body of their Drosophila hosts. During oviposition, female wasps introduce venom into the larval hosts’ body cavity. The venom contains discrete, 300 nm-wide, mixed-strategy extracellular vesicles (MSEVs), until recently referred to as virus-like particles. While the crucial immune suppressive functions of L. heterotoma MSEVs have remained undisputed, their biotic nature and origin still remain controversial. In recent proteomics analyses of L. heterotoma MSEVs, we identified 161 proteins in three classes: conserved eukaryotic proteins, infection and immunity related proteins, and proteins without clear annotation. Here we report 246 additional proteins from the L. heterotoma MSEV proteome. An enrichment analysis of the entire proteome supports vesicular nature of these structures. Sequences for more than 90% of these proteins are present in the whole-body transcriptome. Sequencing and de novo assembly of the 460 Mb-sized L. heterotoma genome revealed 90% of MSEV proteins have coding regions within the genomic scaffolds. Altogether, these results explain the stable association of MSEVs with their wasps, and like other wasp structures, their vertical inheritance. While our results do not rule out a viral origin of MSEVs, they suggest that a similar strategy for co-opting cellular machinery for immune suppression may be shared by other wasps to gain advantage over their hosts. These results are relevant to our understanding of the evolution of figitid and related wasp species.",

      "methods": "Isogenized Lh strains New York (NY; (Chiu and Govind 2002; Chiu et al. 2006)) and Lh 14 (Schlenke et al. 2007), were raised on the y w strain of D. melanogaster that were reared on standard cornmeal, yeast, and agar fly food at 25° as described by Small et al. (2012). Adult wasps were collected from parasitized hosts, 25 days after infection at 25°. Male and female wasps were stored on fly food with 70% honey on “buzz” plugs.",
      "results": "A comparative study of the proteomes of the MSEVs from Lh 14 and Lh NY strains previously generated a list of 161 “common” MSEV proteins (Heavner et al. 2017). More than 90% of the 161 proteins are part of the Lh 14 MSEV proteome. To describe MSEVs more completely, we characterized a larger set of 407 MSEV proteins from Lh 14 (161 common and 246 Lh 14) and define this set as the Lh MSEV “super-set” (Figure 1A). Key results from annotation-based classification, analysis for signal peptide and/or transmembrane domain, and presence/absence of proteins in related wasps are summarized below and in Table S1.",
      "discussion": "The superset of MSEV proteins: (A) Lh 14 MSEV proteins were annotated using BLAST2GO prior to class sorting via annotation and GO Terms. Wedges denoted as “Common,” were previously published in (Heavner et al. 2017) and represent proteins found in both Lh 14 and Lh NY MSEV proteomes. New proteins analyzed in this work are in wedges labeled “Lh 14 Only.” A majority of proteins belong to Class 1. Table S1 lists 246 proteins added to the superset Lh 14 proteome. (B) and (C) Enrichment analysis of MSEV superset shows high association with exosomes and mitochondria compared to other cellular organelles according to Vesiclepedia. –log 10 (p-value) trend shown in orange for both graphs. The p-values were calculated with the Bonferroni method. (B) Percentage of MSEV genes associated with specific cellular compartments found in Vesiclepedia, relative to all MSEV genes. Of the superset proteins, 41 and 49% are associated with mitochondria and exosomes, respectively (P = 3 × 10−57; 1 × 10−53). (C) Fold-enrichment of the MSEV dataset in specific cellular compartments. Although many protein classes are present in the proteome, exosomal and mitochondrial proteins show more significant enrichments."
