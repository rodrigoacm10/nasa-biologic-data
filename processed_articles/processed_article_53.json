      "introduction": "Anhydrobiosis, derived from “life without water” in Greek, is a phenomenon where an organism loses almost all of its water and enters a state of reversible ametabolism (Crowe et al., 1998; Keilin, 1959).",
      "methods": "All plasmids used in this study are summarized in Table S1, along with Benchling links to the plasmid sequences and maps.",
      "results": "We examined changes in the subcellular localization of anhydrobiosis-related proteins in R. varieornatus induced by hyperosmotic stress, which is thought to be an early step in anhydrobiosis.",
      "discussion": "These results not only provide new insights into the mechanism of desiccation tolerance in R. varieornatus, but also suggest a potential use of these CAHS proteins as cryoprotectants."
