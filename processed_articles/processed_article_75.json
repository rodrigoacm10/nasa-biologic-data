    "abstract": "In all eukaryotes, the unfolded protein response (UPR) relieves endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which is a potentially lethal condition caused by the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER. In mammalian and yeast cells, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated during ER stress attenuate the UPR, negatively impacting cell survival. In plants, the relationship between the UPR and ROS is less clear. Although ROS develop during ER stress, the sources of ROS linked to ER stress responses and the physiological impact of ROS generation on the survival from proteotoxic stress are yet unknown.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Physiological and stress situations causing insufficiency of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to meet cellular demands for secretory protein folding lead to a potentially lethal condition, known as ER stress (Gething et al. 1992). To overcome ER stress and restore homeostasis, protective signaling cascades, collectively called the unfolded protein response (UPR), are originated at the ER and lead to the synthesis of ER chaperones and foldases to attenuate ER stress.",
      "methods": "Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia (Col-0), rbohd rbohf, (Torres et al. 2002) ire1a ire1b, and bzip60 bzip28 (Chen et al. 2012, Deng et al. 2013) plants were used in this study.",
      "results": "We first aimed to test whether ER stress activates NADPH Oxidases by establishing the levels of O2−, the product of NADPH Oxidases, in seedlings subjected to induced ER stress conditions.",
      "discussion": "In plants, the identity of several critical sensors and transducers of ER stress has been unraveled (Angelos et al. 2017), and the challenge ahead is to discover additional factors that participate in the UPR management."

The respiratory burst oxidase homologs, RBOHD and RBOHF, contribute to the production of ROS during ER stress. We also demonstrate that during ER stress RBOHD and RBOHF are necessary to properly mount the adaptive UPR and overcome temporary and chronic ER stress situations.",
