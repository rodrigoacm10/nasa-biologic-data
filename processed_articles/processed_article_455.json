    "abstract": "The emergence of double mutation delta (B.1.617.2) variants has dropped vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although COVID-19 is responsible for more than 5.4 M deaths till now, more than 40% of infected individuals are asymptomatic carriers as the immune system of the human body can control the SARS-CoV-2 infection.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "The current global pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for over 5.4 million death till now. It is now well understood that during COVID-19 infection, the spike protein S1 unit containing the receptor-binding domain (S-RBD) facilitates the virus attachment to humans by binding to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in the nasal epithelial mucosal cells, which is the key path for SARS-CoV-2 entry into human host cells.",
      "methods": "GQDs were developed in a two-step process, as shown in Scheme S1 in the Supporting Information. Initially, graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets were synthesized from natural graphite powder using the modified Hummer’s method as we and others have reported before.",
      "results": "The UV–vis spectra from HNP1 and LL-37 human host defense peptide-attached GQDs, as reported in Figure S2E, show two peaks. The first absorption peak is observed at ∼270 nm, which can be due to the π–π* transition, and the second peak is at ∼306 nm, which can be due to the n−π* transition.",
      "discussion": "In conclusion, in the current article, we show that HNP1 and LL-37 peptide-conjugated GQDs can be used to prevent the delta variant virus entry into the host cells by blocking spike protein RBD binding with ACE2."
