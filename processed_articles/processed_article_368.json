    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Candida albicans (C. albicans) is a commensal fungus found throughout the human body in locations such as the mouth, gastrointestinal tract, vagina, and skin [1,2].",
      "methods": "C. albicans (SC5314, American Type Culture Collection) was maintained as a frozen stock at −80 °C.",
      "results": "Although each mission has different timing, the specifics of which change in real time based on the actual launch date and accompanying mission scenario, Table 1 summarizes our general experiences for each payload.",
      "discussion": "As increasing numbers of people spend longer amounts of time in space, it is imperative to understand the physiological adaptations that humans may experience as well as the threats they may encounter."
