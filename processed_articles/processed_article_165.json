    "abstract": "While studies have shown an increase in pathogenicity in several microbes during spaceflight and after exposure to simulated microgravity, the mechanisms underlying these changes in phenotype are not understood across different pathogens, particularly in opportunistic pathogens. This study evaluates the mechanism for increased virulence of the opportunistic gram-negative bacterium, Serratia marcescens, in simulated microgravity. Low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG) is used in ground-based studies to simulate the effects of microgravity as experienced in spaceflight.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Human pathogens occupy a wide variety of ecological niches, including those in the harsh conditions imposed by spaceflight. Understanding the effects that spaceflight may have on the adaptation and fitness of human pathogens is necessary to predict potential causes of health problems during future missions, where the availability of treatment and prevention options is limited.",
      "methods": "Fly lines were maintained in a 12-hour light-dark cycle on cornmeal-agar media (torula yeast, dextrose, cornmeal, agar, Tegosept, propionic acid, ethanol) at ambient temperature (∼24 °C).",
      "results": "Our previous findings have indicated that S. marcescens exposed to LSMMG for 24 h grow at a faster rate inside the host after infection and caused increased host lethality in D.melanogaster.",
      "discussion": "In this study, we provide evidence for the importance of nutrient utilization during bacterial growth as a factor for increased host mortality after pathogen growth in LSMMG."

The results suggest that the increased host lethality induced by LSMMG bacteria grown in rich media can be recapitulated in minimal media by adding only aspartate and glutamine, the substrates of asparagine biosynthesis.",
