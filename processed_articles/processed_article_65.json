    "abstract": "Coat protein complex I (COPI) and COPII are required for bidirectional membrane trafficking between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi. While these core coat machineries and other transport factors are highly conserved across species, high-resolution imaging studies indicate that the organization of the ER–Golgi interface is varied in eukaryotic cells.",

The organization of the ER-Golgi interface is influenced by the types of cargo that must be transported, as well as the overall cell structure and function.",
