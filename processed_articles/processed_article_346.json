    "abstract": "The ongoing rise in global temperatures poses significant challenges to ecosystems, particularly impacting bacterial communities that are central to biogeochemical cycles. The resilience of wild mesophilic bacteria to temperature increases of 2–4 °C remains poorly understood.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Bacteria are often regarded as highly adaptable to extreme environmental changes, including rising temperatures driven by global warming. However, this perception oversimplifies the complexity of bacterial adaptation and does not account for the millions of years it has taken for the diversity of bacteria to adapt to particular niches.",
      "methods": "Bacillus strains were originally isolated from Cuatro Cienegas, Coahuila, México, as described [29]. The strains were collected from sediment in the Churince water system.",
      "results": "We conducted experimental evolution to test if the thermal tolerance of vegetative Bacillus strains could be enhanced through gradual temperature increases (Figure 1A).",
      "discussion": "Our study highlights lineage-specific strategies by using experimental evolution with gradual temperature increases. It reveals significant differences in how Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus cereus lineages evolved thermal tolerance when subjected to gradual temperature increases beyond their thermal niche."
