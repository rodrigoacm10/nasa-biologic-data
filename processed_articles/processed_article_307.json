    "abstract": "As spaceflight becomes more common with commercial crews, blood-based measures of crew health can guide both astronaut biomedicine and countermeasures. By profiling plasma proteins, metabolites, and extracellular vesicles/particles (EVPs) from the SpaceX Inspiration4 crew, we generated “spaceflight secretome profiles,” which showed significant differences in coagulation, oxidative stress, and brain-enriched proteins.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "As spaceflight and long-term human missions become more attainable, minimally invasive approaches to monitor physiological responses to spaceflight in diverse populations will be key to preventing acute and long-term complications. The plasma proteome provides a catalog of proteins circulating in the blood, and thus it can paint an informative picture of the systemic physiological state of astronauts.",
      "methods": "Detailed descriptions of the methods pertaining to all proteomics/metabolomics/transcriptomics assays mentioned in this paper can be found in the “protocol” section of the GeneLab OSDR links found below. Briefly, blood was collected in K2 EDTA tube(s) and shipped overnight on ice.",
      "results": "To gain insight into secretome changes after 3 days of spaceflight, we profiled the plasma EVP proteins and plasma metabolites of the four i4 mission crew members at three pre-launch dates and three post-flight timepoints upon return to Earth.",
      "discussion": "Secretome profiling of the i4 crew after a 3-day spaceflight revealed significant changes in oxidative stress, brain homeostasis, and coagulation markers."
