    "abstract": "The endomembrane system plays essential roles in plant development, but the proteome responsible for its function and organization remains largely uncharacterized in plants. Here, we identified and characterized the HYPERSENSITIVE TO LATRUNCULIN B1 (HLB1) protein isolated through a forward-genetic screen in Arabidopsis thaliana for mutants with heightened sensitivity to actin-disrupting drugs.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Normal plant development relies on the endomembrane system as it plays a central role in directing the delivery of enzyme complexes and polysaccharide precursors to the cell surface and to the vacuole (Kim and Brandizzi, 2014; Kim et al., 2015).",
      "methods": "An Arabidopsis thaliana activation-tagged T-DNA seed stock (CS31100) from the ABRC was sterilized in 95% ethanol and 20% bleach according to Dyachok et al. (2009).",
      "results": "Approximately 20,000 T-DNA activation-tagged seedlings in the Col-0 background were grown on media supplemented with 100 nM LatB.",
      "discussion": "The endomembrane system is essential for normal plant cell development, yet many protein components that modulate its function remain to be identified."
