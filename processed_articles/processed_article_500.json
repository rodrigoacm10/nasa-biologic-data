    "abstract": "Age‐related muscle decline (sarcopenia) associates with numerous health risk factors and poor quality of life. Drugs that counter sarcopenia without harmful side effects are lacking, and repurposing existing pharmaceuticals could expedite realistic clinical options. Recent studies suggest bisphosphonates promote muscle health; however, the efficacy of bisphosphonates as an anti‐sarcopenic therapy is currently unclear.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Age‐related muscle decline, termed ‘sarcopenia’, is classified as a specific disease associated with numerous health risk factors in the elderly, prevalent in at least 10% of older populations and up to 31% as a co‐morbidity. Despite associated annual healthcare costs that run into the billions and significant impacts on individual quality of life and all‐cause mortality, efficacious treatment strategies against sarcopenia remain limited.",
      "methods": "Wild‐type (N2 stain) animals were age synchronized by gravity flotation and ~80 L1 larvae were placed on 33 mm petri dishes (20 L1 per 33 mm plate) containing 2 mL NGM agar [50 mM NaCl, 0.25% (w/v) bacteriological peptone, 1.7% (w/v) agar, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgSO4, 25 mM KH2PO4 (pH 6), 12.9 μM cholesterol] and seeded with 200 μL of OP50 Escherichia coli bacteria.",
      "results": "Higher ZA concentrations (500 and 100 μM) were larval lethal, and 10 μM ZA shortened lifespan (median survival = 11 vs. 14 days for controls, P < 0.0001; Figure 1A) without significantly impairing healthspan (animal movement AUC = 758.9 ± 37.08 vs. 833.9 ± 59.91 for controls, P > 0.05; Figure 1A).",
      "discussion": "Despite the socio‐economic implications, treatment options for sarcopenia remain mostly limited to modifiable lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise, which are incompletely effective."
