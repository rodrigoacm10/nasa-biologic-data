      "methods": "A summary of the microorganisms used in this study can be found in Table 1.",

      "discussion": "In this study, bacterial and fungal strains were exposed to Mars-like environmental conditions onboard the MARSBOx payload during a 7 h balloon flight to the middle stratosphere (∼38 km)."
