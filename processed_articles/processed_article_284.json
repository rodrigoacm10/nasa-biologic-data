    "abstract": "Space missions necessitate physiological and psychological adaptations to environmental factors not present on Earth, some of which present significant risks for the central nervous system (CNS) of crewmembers. One CNS region of interest is the adult olfactory bulb (OB), as OB structure and function are sensitive to environmental- and experience-induced regulation. It is currently unknown how the OB is altered by spaceflight. In this study, we evaluated OB volume and neurogenesis in mice shortly after a 13-day flight on Space Shuttle Atlantis [Space Transport System (STS)-135] relative to two groups of control mice maintained on Earth. Mice housed on Earth in animal enclosure modules that mimicked the conditions onboard STS-135 (AEM-Ground mice) had greater OB volume relative to mice maintained in standard housing on Earth (Vivarium mice), particularly in the granule (GCL) and glomerular (GL) cell layers. AEM-Ground mice also had more OB neuroblasts and fewer apoptotic cells relative to Vivarium mice. However, the AEM-induced increase in OB volume and neurogenesis was not seen in STS-135 mice (AEM-Flight mice), suggesting that spaceflight may have negated the positive effects of the AEM. In fact, when OB volume of AEM-Flight mice was considered, there was a greater density of apoptotic cells relative to AEM-Ground mice. Our findings suggest that factors present during spaceflight have opposing effects on OB size and neurogenesis, and provide insight into potential strategies to preserve OB structure and function during future space missions.",

      "methods": "Female C57BL/6 mice (9 wk of age; Charles River, Wilmington, MA) were shipped directly to NASA Space Life Sciences Laboratory (SLSL) at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on June 21, 2011, where they were housed in identical conditions and allowed to acclimate for >4 wk prior to the start of experimental activities. During this time, mice were weighed ∼3 times/wk and divided into three groups: Vivarium, AEM-Ground, and AEM-Flight. All Vivarium, AEM-Ground, and AEM-Flight mice were chosen from the same shipment of mice with matched birthdates and body weights. AEM-Flight mice flew onboard the STS-135 in animal enclosure modules (AEMs) located on the shuttle's middeck lockers (lockers MF43K, MF57M, and MF57H) for 13 days (July 8, 2011 to July 20, 2011).",
      "results": "As previously reported, body mass of AEM-Ground and AEM-Flight mice was significantly lower at the completion of the STS-135 mission, with AEM-Ground mice weighing slightly more than AEM-Flight mice postflight (96). Total water intake of AEM-Ground mice was greater than AEM-Flight mice (mean ± SE: AEM-Ground 433.3 ± 16.67 ml; AEM-Flight 350.0 ± 0.0 ml; P < 0.001); and water intake per day has also been reported to differ in this same experiment (31).",
      "discussion": "Spaceflight is known to influence numerous aspects of mammalian physiology, including CNS structure and function (17, 19, 65, 84, 96). On Earth, many environmental factors shape OB size and neurogenesis, contributing to olfactory recognition and discrimination (45, 57, 93). Our hypothesis was that exposure to the cumulative factors experienced during spaceflight would have a detrimental effect on OB volume and neurogenesis. Interestingly, our findings here suggest that any negative influence of spaceflight on OB volume and neurogenesis may be prevented or mitigated by exposure to a novel sensory environment, as provided by AEMs."
