      "introduction": "A number of diseases, including osteoporosis and type II diabetes, are thought to increase fracture risk due in part to deteriorated bone quality.",
      "methods": "We first present our new method in detail. Then, to demonstrate utility, we describe results from cyclic testing experiments for three groups of L5 mouse vertebrae, comparing results for our new method against two existing methods from the literature.",
      "results": "Of all three methods tested, the new (KFEA) method produced the lowest variation in fatigue life.",
      "discussion": "Our new method for cyclic loading of small-animal vertebrae yielded highly reproducible measurements of fatigue life and was successful, in part, by effectively controlling for the nominal level of strain applied to these tiny bone specimens."
