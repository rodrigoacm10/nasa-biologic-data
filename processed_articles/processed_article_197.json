    "abstract": "This study reports on a putative eicosanoid biosynthesis pathway in Drosophila melanogaster and challenges the currently held view that mechanistic routes to synthesize eicosanoid or eicosanoid-like biolipids do not exist in insects, since to date, putative fly homologs of most mammalian enzymes have not been identified.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "The eicosanoids are a family of biologically active lipids that have been implicated in various signaling pathways, with a central role in mammalian immunity and inflammation [1–3]. The canonical eicosanoid biosynthesis pathway begins with the release of fatty acids, primarily arachidonic acid (AA), from membrane phospholipids when phospholipase A2 is activated [4,5].",
      "methods": "A flowchart summarizing the general protocol of the present study with the various tools used to identify and characterize putative D. melanogaster orthologs for the classic eicosanoid synthesis enzymes discussed in detail below is shown in Fig 1.",
      "results": "Eight putative orthologs identified in this search have particularly high confidence matches: CG1742, CG4086, CG6084, CG10602, CG6461, CG6154, CG12013 and CG18585.",
      "discussion": "A schematic of a putative D. melanogaster eicosanoid synthesis pathway based on our analysis is shown in Fig 3."
