    "abstract": "Caenorhabditis elegans is a low-cost genetic model that has been flown to the International Space Station to investigate the influence of microgravity on changes in the expression of genes involved in muscle maintenance.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Among the many pathophysiological changes that occur during human spaceflight, muscle atrophy is significant and remains a major impediment to deep space exploration1,2. The postural muscles are most affected in the microgravity environment, therefore, impacting the activities of astronauts in long-duration spaceflight missions.",
      "methods": "Wild-type Bristol isolate (N2) worms were maintained in CeMM (Cell Guidance Systems, Cambridge, UK).",
      "results": "The goal of our spaceflight experiment on ISS is to measure the strength of adult wild-type C. elegans at 4-time points across an 8-week period corresponding to 8 generations.",
      "discussion": "With the human ambition of becoming multi-planetary species, there is a need to understand how the conditions of space (microgravity and radiation) affect the biology and physiology of species grown for multiple generations."
