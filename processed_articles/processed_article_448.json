      "introduction": "Human space exploration is at a turning point. The push for long-duration, crewed missions to the moon and beyond, coupled with the emergence of commercial space tourism is redefining the risks associated with space travel.",
      "methods": "Candidate flight species to use in our analysis were determined from literature42â€“44.",
      "results": "We identified 10 bacterial strains of interest (see Methods): Acinetobacter pittii, Bacillus amyloliquifaecins, Bacillus thuringiensis, Enterobacter bugandensis, Klebsiella quasipneumoniae, Micrococcus luteus, Paenibacillus polymyxa, Pseudomonas fulva, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Staphylococcus saprophyticus.",
      "discussion": "Prophages are cited to be the largest factor associated with strain variation and diversity within terrestrial bacterial species5,7, which holds in the spaceflight environment as phage-associated genes were significantly different in 8 of the 9 phage-containing species analyzed."
