    "abstract": "The health risks of a dysregulated immune response during spaceflight are important to understand as plans emerge for humans to embark on long-term space travel to Mars. In this first-of-its-kind study, we used adoptive transfer of T-cell receptor transgenic OT-II CD4 T cells to track an in vivo antigen-specific immune response that was induced during the course of spaceflight.",

    "insights_summary": "This study found that spaceflight impairs antigen-specific tolerance induction in vivo and increases inflammatory cytokines. The results suggest that the mechanism of impaired tolerance in spaceflight is not due to defects in clonal deletion or anergy, and instead might be related to impaired generation or maintenance of Treg cells.",
