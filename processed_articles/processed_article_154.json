    "abstract": "The effects of spaceflight on cartilaginous structure are largely unknown. To address this deficiency, articular cartilage (AC) and sternal cartilage (SC) from mice exposed to 30 days of microgravity on the BION-M1 craft were investigated for pathological changes.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "The major load-bearing tissue within the joint is articular cartilage (AC). AC is exquisitely sensitive to changes in biomechanical loading (reviewed by Sanchez-Adams et al.1).",
      "methods": "C57BL/6N male mice were flown for 30 days (477 Earth orbits) on the unmanned BION-M1 biosatellite between 19 April and 19 May 2013.",
      "results": "Spaceflight (SF) AC samples demonstrated less proteoglycan compared to AC ground controls (GC) (Fig. 1a).",
      "discussion": "The finding of reduced proteoglycan levels in AC due to microgravity is consistent with hindlimb unloading and limb immobilization studies in rodents, dogs, and rabbits, which consistently report unloading-specific AC atrophy in multiple experimental situations (reviewed in ref. 8)."
