    "abstract": "The advent of phylogenetic DNA microarrays and high-throughput pyrosequencing technologies has dramatically increased the resolution and accuracy of detection of distinct microbial lineages in mixed microbial assemblages.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Microbial cells are traditionally classified as either viable (maintaining active metabolism and membrane integrity), viable but dormant (because of external pressures) or non-viable (dead) (Kaprelyants et al., 1993; Keer and Birch, 2003).",
      "methods": "Nine individual samples (each 1 m2) were collected using Biological Sampling Kit and pooled.",
      "results": "Total bacterial burden, as assessed by bacteria-directed qPCR, is given in Table 1.",
      "discussion": "The application of PMA to assess the differential viability of microbial cells is increasing in popularity within the scientific community (Nocker et al., 2009; van Frankenhuyzen et al., 2011)."
