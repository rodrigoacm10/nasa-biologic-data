      "methods": "The paired-end 100-bp metagenomic reads from NCBI Short Read Archive (SRA) under the bio-project number PRJNA438545 were processed with Trimmomatic to trim adapter sequences and low-quality ends, with a minimum Phred score of 20 across the entire length of the read used as a quality cut-off.",
      "results": "Our results in PMA treated samples revealed AMR dominance in the last flight for Kalamiella piersonii, a bacteria related to urinary tract infection in humans.",
      "discussion": "Many ARGs that present high probability but low sequence identity to known sequences will be missed using traditional ‘best-hit’ approaches that require a high degree of sequence identity."
