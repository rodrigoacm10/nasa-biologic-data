    "abstract": "Evidence indicates that cerebral blood flow is both increased and diminished in astronauts on return to Earth. Data from ground-based animal models simulating the effects of microgravity have shown that decrements in cerebral perfusion are associated with enhanced vasoconstriction and structural remodeling of cerebral arteries.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that 13 d of spaceflight [Space Transportation System (STS)-135 shuttle mission] enhances myogenic vasoconstriction, increases medial wall thickness, and elicits no change in the mechanical properties of mouse cerebral arteries.",
      "methods": "Experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and conformed to the U.S. National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH Publication no. 85-23, revised 1996).",
      "results": "Preflight body mass (20.7±0.4 g) of SF mice was greater (P<0.05) than postflight body mass (18.4±0.5 g).",
      "discussion": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether spaceflight alters the intrinsic myogenic vasoconstrictor, mechanical, or gross structural properties of cerebral arteries from mice flown on the STS-135 space shuttle mission."
