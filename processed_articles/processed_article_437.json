    "abstract": "Given the growing interest in human exploration of space, it is crucial to identify the effects of space conditions on biological processes. Here, we analyze the transcriptomic response of Caenorhabditis elegans to simulated microgravity and observe the maintained transcriptomic response after returning to ground conditions for four, eight, and twelve days.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Significant efforts are being made for the human exploration of space. It is known that space conditions can negatively affect biological processes by causing bone loss, muscle atrophy, and immune system impairment, to name a few examples (reviewed in [1,2]).",
      "methods": "Wild-type N2 strain was obtained from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center (CGC). The worms were grown at 21 °C. Stocks of C. elegans were acclimated to CeHR medium for three weeks prior to microgravity experiments.",
      "results": "To dissect the biological processes affected under simulated microgravity and sustained after the exposure, we first cultured C. elegans in CeHR for three weeks on ground control condition and allowed the worms to acclimate to the liquid culture.",
      "discussion": "In this study, we examined the simulated microgravity responsive gene expression patterns and their maintained levels for four, eight, and twelve days after return to ground conditions."
