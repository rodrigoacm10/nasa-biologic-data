    "abstract": "Low linear energy transfer (LET) gamma rays and high LET HZE (high atomic weight, high energy) particles act as powerful mutagens in both plants and animals. DNA damage generated by HZE particles is more densely clustered than that generated by gamma rays.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "The function of a cell, its capacity to proliferate, and ultimately, its viability, are under constant threat from a diverse array of DNA damaging agents and events.",
      "methods": "The following DNA repair-deficient and cell-cycle checkpoint-deficient alleles were used in our root growth assay: atm-1 (Garcia et al., 2003), atr-3 (Culligan et al., 2004), lig4-1 (Friesner and Britt, 2003), and ku80-1 (Friesner and Britt, 2003); all of which are in the Ws ecotype.",
      "results": "To test the relative impact of high- versus low-LET radiation on root growth, a process governed by both cell division and cell expansion, seeds were irradiated with either high-LET 56Fe particles (HZE) or low-LET 137Cs gamma rays.",
      "discussion": "Our results demonstrate a clear difference in the sensitivity of Arabidopsis to high- versus low-LET radiation."
