    "abstract": "A biological life support system for spaceflight would capture carbon dioxide waste produced by living and working in space to generate useful organic compounds. Photosynthesis is the primary mechanism to fix carbon into organic molecules. Microalgae are highly efficient at converting light, water, and carbon dioxide into biomass, particularly under limiting, artificial light conditions that are a necessity in space photosynthetic production.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Microalgae grow by converting light, water, and CO2 into biomass. Algae have long been proposed for space life support systems to recycle CO2 and provide food either directly or indirectly to astronauts.",
      "methods": "Strains CC-5082 (WT) and CC-1883 (cw15) were obtained from the Chlamydomonas Resource Center.",
      "results": "We tested commercial FEP tissue culture bags for the ability to support microalgae growth without agitation or active mixing of gases with liquids.",
      "discussion": "This EVT validated a strategy for identifying genes required by Chlamydomonas during log phase growth in spaceflight."
