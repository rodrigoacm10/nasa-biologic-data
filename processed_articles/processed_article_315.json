    "abstract": "The ability to grow safe, fresh food to supplement packaged foods of astronauts in space has been an important goal for NASA. Food crops grown in space experience different environmental conditions than plants grown on Earth (e.g., reduced gravity, elevated radiation levels).",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Crop production in space may be a necessary and desirable component of future exploration systems (MacElroy et al., 1992; Kliss et al., 2000). Fresh produce can be grown in situ to supplement a stored, packaged diet, and crops may provide beneficial nutrients as well as dietary variety.",
      "methods": "Red romaine lettuce Lactuca sativa cv. ‘Outredgeous’ was grown in Veggie rooting pillows as described by Massa et al. (2017a).",
      "results": "Aerobic plate counts for the leaves harvested from VEG-01B flight plants were significantly higher than the counts from both harvests of VEG-03A flight and the ground controls (P < 0.05) (Figure 2).",
      "discussion": "Differences in culturable bacterial and fungal density on the leaves in each of the Veggie plantings can not necessarily be traced to a particular source or environmental condition."
