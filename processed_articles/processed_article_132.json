      "introduction": "The vestibular otolith receptors have evolved to detect linear motion and head position with respect to gravity. These are essential functions, about which all coordinated and reflexive movements, as well as spatial orientation and navigation through space depend.",
      "methods": "All experiments were conducted in Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica). Otolith organ tissues were collected and analyzed at ten time points during embryonic development (E6-15; hatch on day 16), as well as at three post-hatch (P) developmental times including P1, P7 and adult (8 weeks post-hatch).",
      "results": "The total areas of the utricular and saccular receptor epithelia were measured (n = 3 - 16 maculae) for each developmental day from E6â€“E15, P0 (hatch), and for post-hatch days P1 (24 hours post-hatch), P7, and P48 (adult).",
      "discussion": "Our findings represent a comprehensive study of the development of the vestibular otolith receptors in birds. We addressed three primary questions."
