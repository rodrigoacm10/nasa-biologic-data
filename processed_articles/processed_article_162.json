      "introduction": "Articular cartilage possesses a complex, zonal architecture that enables smooth articulation at the joint surface and rigid attachment to the subchondral bone.",
      "methods": "The hMSCs were derived from bone marrow aspirates obtained from a healthy, middle-aged adult man with informed consent according to an Institutional Review Board–approved protocol at Case Western Reserve University.",
      "results": "Construct wet and dry weight increased significantly with culture time in both groups.",
      "discussion": "In this study, significant effects of culture duration and medium additives on hMSC-based tissue-engineered cartilage and bone were demonstrated by structural, compositional, mechanical, and genetic methods."
