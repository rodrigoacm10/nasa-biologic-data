    "abstract": "Space travel is associated with an exposure to low-dose rate ionizing radiation and the microgravity environment, both of which may lead to impairments in cardiac function.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Exposure to high doses of ionizing radiation may cause cardiac toxicity that involves pericarditis, fibrosis, conduction abnormalities, coronary heart disease and atherosclerosis [1,2]. While an increased risk of cardiovascular disease has long been shown in radiotherapy patients [3–5], adverse cardiovascular effects, such as ischemic heart disease, have also been described following exposure to doses much lower than in radiation therapy, often decades after radiation exposure [6–8]. Astronauts traveling beyond low earth orbit (LEO), as in a mission to Mars or a near earth asteroid, will be continuously exposed to low dose-rate ionizing radiation, including γ-rays released as secondary radiation resultant from particle radiation interacting with the spacecraft or other shielding material [9]. Hence, there is a concern about potential degenerative tissue effects in the heart with the exposure to ionizing radiation that occurs during space travel.",
      "methods": "All mice were handled and sacrificed by our co-author, XW Mao, at Loma Linda University under AUP 8130028 in a previous study [31]. All data were obtained from cardiac tissue samples collected from that previous study.",
      "results": "Cardiac tissue GSH (S1 Fig) and GSSG (S2 Fig) levels were assessed and GSH:GSSG ratios were calculated as an indication of oxidative stress (Fig 1). GSH:GSSG ratios were significantly decreased 7 days and 1 month after completion of HU or γ-irradiation.",
      "discussion": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of simulated microgravity and low-dose/dose-rate γ-irradiation on cardiac tissue."
