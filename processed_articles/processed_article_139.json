      "introduction": "It has been reported that microgravity induces intracranial hypertension (ICP) and visual impairment intracranial pressure (VIIP) in astronauts after long-duration space missions.",
      "methods": "Two years prior to the space flight, we tested several cell lines to select the most suitable for the space flight in terms of survival and hardware material compatibility, adequate seeding cell number to ensure cells would have enough nutrients for the duration of the trip, and so on.",
      "results": "Upon return from the space flight on board SpX-21, OLPs were recovered from the passive flying hardware, seeded onto glass bottom flaskets and placed in the time-lapse system to ascertain cell proliferation.",
      "discussion": "Gravity, the force that impacts our development, daily lives, and metabolic processes, is an integral part of our life, physiology, and cognition."
