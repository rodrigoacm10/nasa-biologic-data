    "abstract": "Recent studies have provided insights into the persistence and succession of microbes aboard the International Space Station (ISS), notably the dominance of Klebsiella pneumoniae. However, the interactions between the various microbes aboard the ISS and how they shape the microbiome remain to be clearly understood. In this study, we apply a computational approach to predict possible metabolic interactions in the ISS microbiome and shed further light on its organization.",

      "methods": "In this study, a two-pronged computational approach was adopted to investigate and decipher the prevailing microbial interactions in the ISS.",
      "results": "According to the data published by Singh et al. 2018 [15], among the PMA-treated samples, reads of K. pneumoniae were detected in a total of 11 sitesâ€”locations #1, #2, and #5 in Flight 1; location #5 in Flight 2; and locations #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #7, and #8 in Flight 3 (Fig. 2).",
      "discussion": "In this study, we used a metabolic perspective to analyze the ISS microbiome with a focus on K. pneumoniae, a BSL-2 human pathogen, and its coexisting microorganisms."

The results show that K. pneumoniae is beneficial to many of its coexisting microorganisms, especially those belonging to the Pantoea genus. The study also found that K. pneumoniae exhibits parasitic and amensalistic interactions with Aspergillus and Penicillium...",
