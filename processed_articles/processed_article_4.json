      "introduction": "Human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) are easily isolated therapeutic stem cells from adipose tissue.",
      "methods": "Human lipoaspirates were obtained from 12 healthy female donors, average age 42.2 ± 9.3 years (mean ± SD) and average body mass index of 22.4 ± 1.8 kg/m2, who underwent abdominal liposuction.",
      "results": "Cells were expanded for three passages before characterization using flow cytometry and combinations of mesenchymal-cell surface markers.",
      "discussion": "Through novel advances in cell biology, adult stem cells (including hASCs) have been shown to be truly heterogeneous, with subpopulations of cells that may offer potentially greater translational benefits."
