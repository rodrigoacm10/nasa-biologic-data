    "abstract": "Low fluid shear force, including that encountered in microgravity models, induces bacterial responses, but the range of bacteria capable of responding to this signal remains poorly characterized.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "A large body of studies aimed at characterizing the effects of low fluid shear force environments on bacterial cells, including the microgravity environment of spaceflight and ground-based rotating wall vessel (RWV) culture, have focused on the Gram negative enteric pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium [1-7].",
      "methods": "Cultures were grown in the RWV in LB (Lennox) broth as previously described [3, 4, 7].",
      "results": "To determine if the individual members of Enterobacteriaceae exhibited similar growth kinetics in both LSMMG and control conditions (an important parameter for comparing the two culture orientations with a given species), we grew the following members of this family in the RWV in the LSMMG and control orientations (Fig. 2): S. Typhimurium , E. coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, and Serratia marcescens.",
      "discussion": "The results presented here provide significant evidence using several strains and multiple assays that the response to the LSMMG growth environment is conserved across Enterobacteriaceae."
