      "introduction": "Exercise is a powerful antiaging intervention that protects against cardiovascular disease, dementia, diabetes, sarcopenia, and cancer. How exercise promotes health benefits to multiple tissues in the body, however, remains poorly understood.",
      "methods": "The C. elegans strains used in this study were: N2 (WT strain), SJ4103 zcIs14[Pmyo-3mitoGFP] (61), BR6563 byIs161[Prab-3F3ΔK280; Pmyo-2mCherry]; bkIs10[Paex-3h4R1NTauV337M; Pmyo-2GFP] (43), BR5707 byIs161[Prab-3F3ΔK280; Pmyo-2mCherry]; bkIs10[Paex-3h4R1NTauV337M; Pmyo-2GFP]; juIs73[Punc-25GFP] III (43), CL2355 smg-1(cc546ts) dvIs50[Psnb-1Aβ1–42::long 3′-UTR Pmtl-2GFP] I (45), and ID1 igIs1[Pmec-3htt57Q128::CFP, Pmec-7YFP, lin-15(+)] (46).",
      "results": "Multiple daily swim sessions are essential for C. elegans exercise adaptation. (A) Diagram of the 90-min swim session protocol performed for each exercise bout. We transferred control animals to an unseeded NGM plate for 90 min, whereas exercise animals were transferred to an unseeded NGM plate flooded with M9 buffer for the same 90 min to swim.",
      "discussion": "The development of short-lived genetic models in which fundamental questions of exercise biology can be evaluated throughout the entire aging process holds great potential for advancing our knowledge on transtissue exercise signaling that improves old-age health."
