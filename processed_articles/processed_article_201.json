    "abstract": "As generalist parasitoid wasps, Leptopilina heterotoma are highly successful on many species of fruit flies of the genus Drosophila. The parasitoids produce specialized multi-strategy extracellular vesicle (EV)-like structures in their venom. Proteomic analysis identified several immunity-associated proteins, including the knottin peptide, LhKNOT, containing the structurally conserved inhibitor cysteine knot (ICK) fold, which is present in proteins from diverse taxa.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "In host–parasite interactions, the parasite must provide offensive pressure while simultaneously keeping the host alive to sustain viable offspring [1,2]. Such conflicting goals have led to the evolution of virulence factors with diverse molecular strategies while maintaining high host specificity.",
      "methods": "Initial scans of the NCBI non-redundant protein sequence (nr) database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein; accessed on 4 April 2018), the Transcriptome Shotgun Assembly (TSA) sequences database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/tsa; accessed on 16 April 2018) [66], and the Protein Data Bank (PDB; https://www.rcsb.org; accessed on 5 July 2018) [67] with the full-length amino acid sequence of the L. heterotoma knottin peptide (GAJC01011813.1) using NCBI BLAST (BLASTp; https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi; accessed on 16 April 2018) [68] were used to retrieve related protein sequences in other organisms.",
      "results": "A BLASTp search of the nr and TSA databases using the full-length LhKNOT sequence (60 amino acids) showed a limited number of significant hits, primarily annotated as “antimicrobial peptides”, from plants and insects.",
      "discussion": "Biochemical functions of proteins are facilitated by their overall structures, which are reportedly 3–10 times more well-conserved than their primary structures [45]. Consequently, sequence alignments often fall short in investigating the functional potential of proteins such as knottins, where the varied primary structures may obscure shared structure–function relationships."
