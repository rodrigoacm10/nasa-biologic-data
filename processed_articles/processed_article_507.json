    "abstract": "Mouse models are critical tools in tuberculosis (TB) research. Recent studies have demonstrated that the wild mouse gut microbiota promotes host fitness and improves disease resistance. Here we examine whether the wild mouse gut microbiota alters the immunopathology of TB in BALB/c mice.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major threat to global public health and years of progress made towards ending TB have been reversed by the COVID19 pandemic [1]. Predictive preclinical models for testing novel drugs and vaccine candidates are required to achieve the targets set forth in the End TB Strategy.",
      "methods": "This study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.",
      "results": "We used commercially available age-matched cohorts of LabC mice and WildR mice [10, 11] that were generated in the BALB/c background.",
      "discussion": "The BALB/c mouse model has been a workhorse in TB preclinical therapy development for many decades, but results do not always align with humans."
