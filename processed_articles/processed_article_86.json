    "abstract": "Enterococcus faecalis is a multidrug resistant, opportunistic human pathogen and a leading cause of hospital acquired infections. Recently, isolates have been recovered from the air and surfaces onboard the International Space Station (ISS). Pangenomic and functional analyses were carried out to assess their potential impact on astronaut health.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Enterococcus faecalis represent a core, yet quantitatively minor portion of the human gut microbiome (Schloissnig et al., 2013) that are well suited to persist outside of the host environment.",
      "methods": "Bacterial isolates from the ISS (Figure 1 and Table 1) were initially recovered on tryptic soy agar, and preliminary identification was performed using a VITEK identification system (bioMÃ©rieux, Hazelwood, MO, United States) as previously described (Castro et al., 2004).",
      "results": "The E. faecalis isolates recovered from air samples (ISS_1 and ISS_4) were both collected mid-module.",
      "discussion": "While multiple studies have detected the presence of a wide range of opportunistic human pathogens onboard the ISS, the consensus was that additional data was needed to determine if these microorganisms posed an actual threat to crew health."
