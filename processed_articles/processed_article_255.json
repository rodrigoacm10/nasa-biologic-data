    "abstract": "Fungi are versatile organisms which thrive in hostile environments, including the International Space Station (ISS). Several isolates of the human pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus have been found contaminating the ISS, an environment with increased exposure to UV radiation.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Recent revitalization of the interest in human outer space explorations has brought attention to the question of whether and how microbes, particularly pathogenic microbes, respond and adapt to space conditions (1–4). Being ubiquitous in the environment and isolated from a variety of extreme and built environments, fungi are compelling microorganisms to evaluate such adaptive responses (5–9).",
      "methods": "The strains used in this study are listed in Table S1. The generated mutants were stored in 30% (vol/vol) glycerol in 0.01% (vol/vol) Tween 80 at −80°C.",
      "results": "Three control strains, namely, Af293, an ΔakuA mutant, and a ΔakuA -mluc mutant, were examined to demonstrate the impact of the disruption of akuA in UV-C response.",
      "discussion": "While the radiation-protective properties of melanin in fungi have been previously documented (21, 22, 48, 49), little is known about the UV-C-protective features of other SMs or of DHN-melanin in A. fumigatus."

    "insights_summary": "This study demonstrated that akuA, which plays fundamental role in the nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway, a preferred DNA repair pathway of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in fungi, is critical in protection from UV-C. The disruption of akuA gene, which increases the transformation success rate via homologous recombination (HR), led to a ca. 90% decrease in survival upon exposure to the...",
