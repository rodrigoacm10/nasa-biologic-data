    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Plants undergo substantial physiological adaptation to accommodate changing environments. As sessile organisms, plants have developed exquisitely sensitive metabolisms that can provide insights into how eukaryotes sense and respond to external stimuli.",
      "methods": "The data presented here are from plants harvested during one of several experiments launched to the ISS on STS-129, November 16, 2009 (specifically, Run 1B: 12/3/2009â€“12/15/2009), and returned on STS-130, February 8, 2010.",
      "results": "Over 1500 proteins were identified in the root and leaf samples at a global FDR of 5% against the decoy database, and over 1300 proteins in each sample at an FDR of 1%.",
      "discussion": "This study demonstrated that sufficient protein amounts can be isolated from ISS samples preserved in RNAlater to allow broad-scale proteomics studies."
