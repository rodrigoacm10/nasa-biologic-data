    "abstract": "Main conclusion Blue-light positive phototropism in roots is masked by gravity and revealed in conditions of microgravity. In addition, the magnitude of red-light positive phototropic curvature is correlated to the magnitude of gravity.",

      "introduction": "Plant tropisms are growth-mediated movements relative to the direction of an external stimulus. In early studies, these movements were first characterized by Darwin and Darwin (1880), however, description of plant movement actually dates back to the Ancient Romans (Ovid 8 AD 2008). Plants exhibit these growth-mediated responses to external cues, including water (hydrotropism, Kiss 2007), touch or contact (thigmotropism, Braam 2005), the sun or light (heliotropism and phototropism, respectively Briggs 1964; Vandenbrink et al. 2014a, b; Kutschera and Briggs 2016), and gravity (gravitropism, Chen et al. 1999; Kiss 2000) among others.",
      "methods": "Three genotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana were utilized for this study (Lehle Seeds, Round Rock, TX, USA): wild-type ecotype Landsberg erecta (Ler), and the phytochrome mutant’s phyA-201 and phyB-1 (Kiss et al. 2003). Space-flight studies were conducted utilizing the EMCS on the ISS.",
      "results": "The phototropic response in roots was measured as positive growth (towards photostimulation) or negative growth (away from photostimulation) from the initial vertical state.",
      "discussion": "Results from these experiments expand upon and optimize the previous experiments performed under conditions of microgravity and reduced gravity on board the ISS (Table 3)."
