    "sections": {
      "introduction": "The plant plasma membrane serves as a selective physical barrier between intracellular contents and the environment as well as a signaling platform for transmitting information from the exterior to induce cellular responses.",
      "methods": "Arabidopsis PIP2A-GFP seeds were sterilized and sowed on half-strength Murashige and Skoog (½ MS) media with vitamins, 1% (w/v) sucrose, and 0.8% (w/v) agar.",
      "results": "We chose to use a transgenic line expressing PIP2A-GFP as the plant material for our experiments because PIP2A-GFP is localized predominantly at the plasma membrane by microscopy and its cellular localization is not affected by 2 h of 40 μM ES2 treatment.",
      "discussion": "Using quantitative and comparative proteomics analysis, we identified 145 proteins with significantly reduced abundance at the plasma membrane of Arabidopsis roots following ES2 treatment."
