    "abstract": "Force magnitudes have been suggested to drive the structural response of bone to exercise. As importantly, the degree to which any given bone can adapt to functional challenges may be enabled, or constrained, by regional variation in the capacity of marrow progenitors to differentiate into bone-forming cells.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Numerous aspects of organismal structure and function can be positively affected by load-bearing exercise, not least of which is the skeleton. Studies of humans and other animals frequently demonstrate the potential for activities such as running and jumping to promote bone formation, delay bone loss, and, ultimately, enhance skeletal structure and strength.",
      "methods": "All experiments and procedures were reviewed and approved by the Stony Brook University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.",
      "results": "To assess the relationship between the magnitude of loads produced by exercise and the site-specific osteogenic response, we first determined whether the forelimbs or hindlimbs experience greater external forces during mouse quadrupedal locomotion.",
      "discussion": "This study demonstrates the adaptive capacity of the mouse skeleton to be site-specific, with some regions being more responsive than others to exercise-induced loads."
