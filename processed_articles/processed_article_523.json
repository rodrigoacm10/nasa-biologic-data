    "abstract": "Secondary metabolite (SM) production in Aspergillus niger JSC-093350089, isolated from the International Space Station (ISS), is reported, along with a comparison to the experimentally established strain ATCC 1015.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Filamentous fungi are ubiquitous in spacecraft environments due to anthropogenic contamination and an inability to completely sterilize the craft and cargo (Pierson, 2001; Novikova et al., 2006; Van Houdt et al., 2012). Microbial infections are a major health risk for astronauts, and are exacerbated by the combined stresses of microgravity, sleep disruption, alterations in food intake, confined living space, and high levels of radiation that can compromise the immune system (Pierson, 2001; Sonnenfeld et al., 2003).",
      "methods": "JSC-093350089 and ATCC 1015 were cultivated at 28°C on GMM agar plates, starting with 1 × 107 spores per Petri dish (D = 10 cm).",
      "results": "SM profiles of JSC-093350089 and ATCC 1015 were examined after growth on GMM agar medium using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with diode-array detection and electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-DAD-MS).",
      "discussion": "Metabolomic analysis of the A. niger laboratory strain and ISS isolate revealed significant differences in SM production levels."
