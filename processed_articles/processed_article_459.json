      "introduction": "Infection by cytomegalovirus (CMV), a member of the herpesvirus family, is highly prevalent in the human population, with estimated rates of infection ranging from 50% in developed countries to 90% in developing countries [1].",
      "methods": "Kasumi-3 cells (hematopoietic stem cell-derived monocyte progenitor cells) (ATCC CRL-2725, ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) were cultured in RPMI 1640 Medium (ATCC 30-2001) with 20% Fetal Bovine Serum (ATCC 30-2020), 20 U/mL penicillin, and 20 µg/mL Streptomycin.",
      "results": "CMV viral load (copies/10,000 total cells) of CMV-infected Kasumi-3 cells separated by radiation source (A–F) and analyzed by dose (column 1), timepoint (column 2), and dose and timepoint (column 3).",
      "discussion": "Herpes viral reactivations in astronauts have generally been subclinical. However, medical events with viral etiology have occurred during spaceflight [10]."
