    "abstract": "Organismal adaptations to spaceflight have been characterized at the molecular level in model organisms, including Drosophila and C. elegans. Here, we extend molecular work to energy metabolism and sex hormone signaling in mice and humans. We found spaceflight induced changes in insulin and estrogen signaling in rodents and humans. Murine changes were most prominent in the liver, where we observed inhibition of insulin and estrogen receptor signaling with concomitant hepatic insulin resistance and steatosis. Based on the metabolic demand, metabolic pathways mediated by insulin and estrogen vary among muscles, specifically between the soleus and extensor digitorum longus. In humans, spaceflight induced changes in insulin and estrogen related genes and pathways. Pathway analysis demonstrated spaceflight induced changes in insulin resistance, estrogen signaling, stress response, and viral infection. These data strongly suggest the need for further research on the metabolic and reproductive endocrinologic effects of space travel, if we are to become a successful interplanetary species.",

      "introduction": "We have entered an era in which living and working in space is a reality. Studies show that spaceflight has health risks such as central nervous system and cardiovascular dysfunction, cancer risk, immune dysregulation, muscle and bone loss, and fatty liver1. At the molecular level, risks include oxidative stress, DNA damage, cosmic radiation exposure, mitochondrial dysfunction, microbiome shift, and epigenetic alterations1. Of these, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress have been identified as major space-related risks2. Mitochondria are not only the powerhouse of the cell but also the center of many metabolic pathways. Insulin is a highly conserved anabolic and mitogenic peptide hormone that acts as a master regulator of energy metabolism across species, including humans3. It is secreted by the pancreas in response to increased plasma glucose, and exerts its effects on most organs including the kidney and liver as well as skeletal muscle, and bone4. Insulin receptor is a transmembrane receptor belonging to the family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs)5 and undergoes autophosphorylation upon activation, leading to a downstream signaling cascade which influences cellular function, particularly glucose metabolism. Insulin resistance (IR) arises when these downstream molecular pathways do not respond appropriately in target tissues, thus impeding the physiologic response to insulin. In the physiological state, IR can also be observed due to opposing actions from counterregulatory hormones such as glucagon, glucocorticoids, and catecholamines. Insulin resistance is further associated with metabolic abnormalities such as diabetes, lipid dysfunction, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), cardiovascular disease, retinopathy, and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Each of these factors is also interconnected, thus resulting in a potentially vicious cycle.",
      "methods": "All omics data related to mouse samples were obtained from NASA’s GeneLab public omics repository86. The data derived from spaceflight experiments carried out onboard the ISS as part of the Rodent Research-1 (RR-1), RR-5, RR-7, and MHU-2 missions. A description of the experimental design, the corresponding type of tissues, and the data accessed are summarized in Supplementary Table 1. All previous animal experiments and methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines at each principal investigators’ institutions and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use committee (IACUC). A detailed description of the methodology for obtaining tissue samples and processing is available in NASA’s GeneLab platform.",
      "results": "To understand how insulin and estrogen signaling change during spaceflight we examined gene expression in mice that were flown to the International Space Station (ISS) for 37 days. For this purpose, adrenal glands (OSD-98), kidney (OSD-102), liver (OSD-168), eyes (OSD-100), and skeletal muscles (i.e. quadriceps (OSD-103), gastrocnemius (OSD-101), soleus (OSD-104), tibialis anterior (OSD-105), and extensor digitorum longus (OSD-99)) were utilized (Fig. 1a). The transcriptomic data (RNA-seq) was obtained for 16-week-old female mice from the NASA GeneLab platform28 and were analyzed for insulin signaling, estrogen signaling and insulin resistance related genes and pathways. The gene lists for these hormones were obtained from the NCBI resource29 (i.e. ‘insulin signaling’ mus musculus). The greatest number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were observed in the mouse liver (n = 3670), followed by soleus (n = 3518) and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) (n = 1859) muscles. In all, 2677 DEGs were unique to the liver, 2048 DEGs were unique to soleus muscle, and 784 DEGs were unique to EDL (Fig. 1b). The least number of DEGs was noted in the adrenal gland (n = 61) and 28 of them were unique to it (Fig. 1b). There are a total of 1970 unique genes from the NCBI curated gene list which are commonly encountered across insulin resistance, insulin signaling and estrogen signaling pathways. Most of the genes from the NCBI list related to insulin resistance, insulin signaling, and estrogen signaling were downregulated in the liver (Fig. 1c). In total, 645 out of the 1970 unique genes from the NCBI resource had gene expression values across all nine tissues. These genes were divided into seven biologically relevant clusters associated with insulin resistance and signaling (Fig. 1d). In particular, the last cluster (cluster 7) at the bottom of the heatmap were related to Gene Ontology (GO) processes30 such as lipid localization and glycerolipid metabolic processes which are relate",
      "discussion": "Consistent with past reports that insulin signaling is a central regulator of gene expression changes and lipid metabolism in response to spaceflight in the worm, C. elegans64,65, we find that gene expression changes related to insulin signaling occur in spaceflown rodents and humans. Further, we find that estrogen signaling gene expression changes also occur in both spaceflown rodents and humans."
