    "abstract": "Somatosensory neurons mediate responses to diverse mechanical stimuli, from innocuous touch to noxious pain. While recent studies have identified distinct populations of A mechanonociceptors (AMs) that are required for mechanical pain, the molecular underpinnings of mechanonociception remain unknown.",

      "introduction": "Pain is a complex sensation. It serves to protect organisms from harmful stimuli, but can also become chronic and debilitating following tissue injury and disease.",
      "methods": "S1pr3mcherry/+ and S1pr3-/- mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratory and backcrossed to C57bl6/J.",
      "results": "We first examined a variety of somatosensory behaviors in mice lacking S1PR3 (Kono et al., 2004) (S1pr3tm1Rlp/Mmnc; referred to herein as S1PR3 KO).",
      "discussion": "We now show that S1P signaling via S1PR3 is a key pathway that tunes mechanical pain sensitivity."
