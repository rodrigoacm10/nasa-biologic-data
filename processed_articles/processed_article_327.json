    "abstract": "Space is a unique environment characterized by isolation from community life and exposure to circadian misalignment, microgravity, and space radiation. These multiple differences from those experienced on the earth may cause systemic and local tissue stress. Autonomic nerves, including sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves, regulate functions in multiple organs. Saliva is secreted from the salivary gland, which is regulated by autonomic nerves, and plays several important roles in the oral cavity and digestive processes.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "The transition from 1 g to the space environment changes not only gravity but also various other conditions such as the circadian rhythm (Otsuka et al., 2018) and exposure to cosmic rays (Zeitlin et al., 2013). It is important to elucidate the medical risks that humans face when living in a space environment, such as the oxidative stress caused by cosmic radiation (Overbey et al., 2019) and mechanical stress caused by microgravity (Dadwal et al., 2019). Artificial imitation of these environments may provide an understanding of gravitational physiology and determine how to avoid space stress.",
      "methods": "C57BL/6 J male mice (Stock #000664) obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME, United States) and Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA, United States) were used for the MHU-4 and -5 missions.",
      "results": "We found that lunar gravity induced the expression of the salivary amylase gene Amy1; however, no increase in Aqp5 and Ano1, which regulate water secretion, was observed.",
      "discussion": "In the 1/6 g lunar gravitational environment, Amy1 was upregulated in the submandibular glands, as were Vamp8 and the small G protein Rap1 (Ras family)/Rab2a, Rab10, and Rab27 (Rab family) which are involved in vesicle secretion."
