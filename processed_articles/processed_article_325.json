      "introduction": "Spaceflight exposes organisms to numerous environmental stressors, such as gravitational changes, radiation, temperature fluctuations, vibration, noise, confinement, and disruption of sleep and circadian rhythms.",
      "methods": "Eight 16-23 wk old female C57BL/6J mice were flown for 15 d on space shuttle Discovery (Space Transportation System [STS]-131), and seven 9 wk old female C57BL/6J mice were flown for 13 d on space shuttle Atlantis (STS-135).",
      "results": "The flight and habitat ground control mice from both space shuttle missions lost approximately 1-2 g of body weight, but the differences were not statistically significant.",
      "discussion": "In the submandibular gland, as in the parotid and sublingual glands of these mice, spaceflight resulted in specific changes in secretory protein expression."
