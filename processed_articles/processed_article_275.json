      "introduction": "Microbial communities are an integral part of space exploration: they accompany human crew in habitats such as the International Space Station [1] and they will ultimately be used for bioregenerative life support [2], food and pharmaceuticals production [3], and in situ resource utilization [4].",
      "methods": "CAMDLES is dependent on parent software packages to run simulations. Installation involves the addition of the package into the source code of the packages LIGGGHTS and CFDEM Coupling.",
      "results": "For the first set of CAMDLES simulations, we tested the hypothesis that co-localization is necessary to enable high growth rates in the simplest environment: no gravity force.",
      "discussion": "In this study, we used CFD-DEM modeling to investigate the relationship between the physical environment and the ecological interactions in a microbial community."
