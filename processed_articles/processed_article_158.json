      "introduction": "All animals form beneficial associations with microbes, and these symbioses, collectively called the microbiome, constitute a powerful determinant of development, health, and fitness1,2.",
      "methods": "The strains of V. fischeri used in this study include: wild-type V. fischeri ES11484; the non-motile, flagellated, mutant motB1::Tn7ermR; and the non-flagellated mutant flhA::Tn7ermR45.",
      "results": "During exponential growth in the HARV reactors, V. fischeri cells released significantly more LPS under LSMMG conditions than gravity controls even after being normalized by optical density, an indicator of cell mass (Fig. 2a).",
      "discussion": "Over the coming decade, human-led exploration of space will likely move beyond low Earth orbit into deeper space50."
