      "introduction": "Throughout history, humans have explored the earth, so much so, that few regions outside of the ocean depths still remain unexplored. This drive to go “where no man has gone before,” coupled with increasing pollution, climate change, and competition for scarcer resources, has brought humans to the point at which exploration and exploitation of other celestial bodies, such as the moon, asteroids, and other planets, is inevitable. However, our organ systems have evolved to work under 1g, and it is not clear what the effect of long-term exposure to lower gravity environments might be and how those effects are exerted at the cellular and molecular levels.",
      "methods": "",
      "results": "We used vented fly boxes (VFBs) to carry multiple vials of adult Drosophila, each with 10 females and 5 males, to the ISS (see protocol schematic; Figure 1A). Eggs laid on the food in the bottom of the vials hatched into larva that then metamorphosed into adults in about 10–12 days, all under microgravity. VFBs and vials containing live adult flies were returned to earth gravity, and flies were processed within ~2 days of exposure to 1g (space-flown [SF] flies). We also collected flies that emerged from those same vials at 1g (days 3–5 after splash down) and aged them for 2 weeks at 1g before processing (space flight recovery [SFR]).",
      "discussion": "As humans increasingly venture into our interplanetary space, it will be important to understand the different ways in which prolonged exposure to altered g forces affect organ systems that have evolved under 1g. Muscle function is known to be affected by prolonged weightlessness, but most studies address the “bulk” properties of muscle fibers, leaving the cellular and mechanistic causes relatively unexplored."

    "insights_summary": "Prolonged exposure to microgravity reduces cardiac contractility and initiates remodeling in Drosophila. The effects are consistent with observed myofibrillar remodeling, reduced sarcomere count, and misregulation of sarcomeric genes. Proteosome gene or protein expression is upregulated, suggesting proteostasis imbalance.",
