    "abstract": "Bone marrow adipose tissue (MAT) is negatively associated with bone mass. Since osteoblasts and adipocytes are derived from the same precursor cells, adipocyte differentiation may occur at the expense of osteoblast differentiation. We used MAT-deficient KitW/Wâˆ’v (MAT-) mice to determine if absence of MAT reduced bone loss in hindlimb-unloaded (HU) mice.",
