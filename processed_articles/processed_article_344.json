    "abstract": "The roles of various core components, including α/β/γ-type small acid-soluble spore proteins (SASP), dipicolinic acid (DPA), core water content, and DNA repair by apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonucleases or nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), in Bacillus subtilis spore resistance to different types of ionizing radiation including X rays, protons, and high-energy charged iron ions have been studied.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Spores of Bacillus subtilis have been used extensively as biological indicators for industrial purposes such as sterilization or decontamination. Spores have also been shown to be suitable dosimeters for probing terrestrial and extraterrestrial ionizing radiation in environmental and astrobiological studies (1–3; reviewed in references 4, 5, 6, and 7).",
      "methods": "The B. subtilis strains used in this work are listed in Table 1, and all are isogenic with the wild-type strain PS832.",
      "results": "Wild-type and mutant spores (Table 1) were subjected to three different types of ionizing radiation, X rays, protons, and high-energy Fe ions.",
      "discussion": "In regard to the characteristic resistance to ionizing radiation, spores of the Gram-positive bacterium B. subtilis have often been used to evaluate sterilization efforts in areas of food preservation, medical sterilization, and decontamination of potential biohazardous materials (3, 4, 6)."
