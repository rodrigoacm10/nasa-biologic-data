    "abstract": "Isolated across four locations aboard the International Space Station (ISS), 10 bacterial strains were compared using whole-genome sequencing analysis and were phylogenetically identified as Klebsiella. The whole-genome sequences will aid in comparative genomic studies of ISS Klebsiella strains with Earth counterparts to gain insight into their adaptation to space conditions.",
