      "introduction": "The World Health Organization published a surveillance strategy report in 2015 stating that worldwide, non-infectious disease (NIDs) represented 43% of global disease burden and was expected to be responsible for 60% of the disease burden and 73% of all deaths by 2020s [1].",
      "methods": "Saliva samples were collected from 10 male astronauts at various time points over the course of their mission.",
      "results": "Eighty-nine samples from ten astronauts were analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing for microbiome analysis and qPCR for viral titer measurements.",
      "discussion": "The human microbiome has become a powerful tool to help predict and modulate health and disease."
