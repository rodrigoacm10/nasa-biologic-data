    "abstract": "Sixteen-week-old female C57BL/6J mice were sacrificed aboard the International Space Station after 37 days of flight (RR-1 mission) and frozen carcasses returned to Earth. RNA was isolated from interscapular brown adipose tissue (BAT) and gonadal white adipose tissue (WAT). Spaceflight resulted in differential expression of genes in BAT consistent with increased non-shivering thermogenesis and differential expression of genes in WAT consistent with increased glucose uptake and metabolism, adipogenesis, and β-oxidation.",

      "methods": "Details of the spaceflight mission are published25. Animal protocol was reviewed and approved by the NASA Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee prior to the conduct of experiments. In brief, 16-week-old female B6 mice were sacrificed aboard the ISS after 37 days of flight and frozen carcasses were returned to Earth for tissue preparation and method validation as described21. Sensors in the Habitats (flight and ground) monitored and relayed information including component temperature and humidity. The data were logged at sampling rate of 1 Hz. Ground control mice were sacrificed and processed using the same timelines and protocols as the flight animals.",
