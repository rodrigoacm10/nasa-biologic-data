      "introduction": "Biofilms are cell populations that grow embedded in an extracellular matrix (ECM), which has effects on its ability to adhere to itself and to surfaces, and which changes the interaction between cells and nutrients, quorum-sensing molecules, and its environment in general [1].",
      "methods": "Penicillium rubens ATCC® 28089™ was chosen given the genus ubiquity in space stations and this specific strain’s presence (and damage caused) in the Mir space station [8,11].",
      "results": "The results presented below in Section 3.3, Section 3.4, Section 3.5, Section 3.6, Section 3.7, Section 3.8 and Section 3.9 are all statistically significant results.",
      "discussion": "The primary aim of this investigation was to characterize P. rubens biofilm morphology on seven clinically or spaceflight relevant materials both in space and on Earth."
