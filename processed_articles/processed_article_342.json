      "introduction": "Recently it was reported that Carnobacterium sp. strain WN1359, isolated from Siberian permafrost, was capable of growth under a combination of low-temperature (0°C), low-pressure (0.7-kPa), and CO2-enriched anoxic conditions intended to simulate the atmosphere of Mars (1).",
