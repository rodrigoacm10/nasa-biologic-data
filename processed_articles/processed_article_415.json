    "abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus colonizes the nares of approximately 30% of humans, a risk factor for opportunistic infections. To gain insight into S. aureus virulence potential in the spaceflight environment, we analyzed RNA-Seq, cellular proteomics, and metabolomics data from the “Biological Research in Canisters-23” (BRIC-23) GeneLab spaceflight experiment, a mission designed to measure the response of S. aureus to growth in low earth orbit on the international space station.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Staphylococcus aureus is a pernicious pathogen capable of infecting nearly every tissue and organ system in the human body. Most S. aureus strains are resistant to multiple antibiotics, and certain isolates are resistant to nearly all antibiotics used in the clinical setting.",
      "methods": "A general overview of the BRIC-23 flight (FLT) experiment is outlined in Fig. 1, and complete details have been previously described20,21. In brief, two BRIC-PDFUs (each containing five 60 mm Petri dishes with 107 CFU of S. aureus UAMS-123 cells dried on the bottom of each plate) were launched to the ISS on SpaceX CRS-9 on 07/18/2016.",
      "results": "Principle components analysis (PCA) was performed on all quantile normalized Reads Per Kilobase of transcript, per Million mapped reads (RPKM) gene expression values from the BRIC-23 FLT and GC RNA-Seq samples (n = 9 per experimental group) (Fig. 2a).",
      "discussion": "Our analysis of the S. aureus RNA-Seq, proteomics, secretomics, and metabolomics datasets from BRIC-23 indicate that S. aureus undergoes significant alterations in physiology and virulence factor production in the spaceflight environment which could alter its pathogenic potential for astronauts conducting long-term spaceflight missions."
