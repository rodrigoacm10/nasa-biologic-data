      "introduction": "As a species, we have been working and living in space for more than 60 years, with continuous occupation for the last 23 years via the International Space Station (ISS) [1].",

      "results": "Neuromuscular strength was lower in flight versus ground controls (16.6% decline, p < 0.05), with dys-1 significantly more (23% less strength, p < 0.01) affected than wild types.",
      "discussion": "Historically, space biology experiments have been constrained by mass, power, size, and crew time limitations [117]."
