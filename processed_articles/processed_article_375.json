      "introduction": "Long duration human missions to Mars must rely on more than just stored supplies and physico-chemical means to regenerate air and clean water.",
      "methods": "A homozygous knockout T-DNA insertion line for AtMRS2-10 (At1g80900) was identified by PCR and RT-PCR using the original SALK_100361.41.30.x line.",
      "results": "The growth performance of transporter gene knockout mutant lines and their respective wildtype backgrounds grown for four weeks on soil treated with MgSO4·7H2O in solution (0–100 mM) was compared on the basis of shoot fresh weight (FW) biomass and leaf chlorophyll levels.",
      "discussion": "The use of regolith on Mars with high levels of hydrated sulfate minerals for bioregenerative life support systems will lead to exposure of plant roots to supra-optimal concentrations of both Mg2+ and SO42− ions in the soil solution."
