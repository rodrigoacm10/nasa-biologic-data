    "abstract": "Bacteria are able to adapt and survive in harsh and changing environments through many mechanisms, with one of them being horizontal gene transfer (HGT). This process is one of the leading culprits in the spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) within bacterial communities and could pose a significant health threat to astronauts if they fell ill, especially on long-duration space missions.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Bacteria are able to adapt to a wide variety of conditions, as evidenced by their survival and growth in extreme environments, such as the arid Atacama desert [1], hypersaline salt mines and lakes [2,3], acidic rocks in the Yellowstone geothermal environment [4], and the multi-stressor environment of Antarctica [5].",
      "methods": "Donor (A. pittii strain IIF1SW-P1) and recipient (S. aureus strains IF4SW-P1, IIF6SW-P1, IF7SW-P3, IIF8SW-P1) bacteria were streaked from −80 °C freezer stocks onto tryptic soy agar plates (Hardy Diagnostics, Santa Maria, CA, USA) and incubated overnight (~16 h) at 37 °C.",
      "results": "In order to determine whether HGT occurred between donor and recipient, suitable PCR primers were designed to amplify regions of the blaOXA-500 and ISAba1 genes from A. pittii IIF1SW-P1.",
      "discussion": "We have shown that HGT is increased under SMG compared to 1G. The transfer of AMR genes, which were tracked by PCR, occurred in the absence of selective pressure by antibiotics."
