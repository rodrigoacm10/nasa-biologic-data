    "abstract": "The vestibular system receives a permanent influence from gravity and reflexively controls equilibrium. If we assume gravity has remained constant during the species' evolution, will its sensory system adapt to abrupt loss of that force? We address this question in the land snail Helix lucorum exposed to 30 days of near weightlessness aboard the Bion-M1 satellite, and studied geotactic behavior of postflight snails, differential gene expressions in statocyst transcriptome, and electrophysiological responses of mechanoreceptors to applied tilts. Each approach revealed plastic changes in the snail's vestibular system assumed in response to spaceflight. Absence of light during the mission also affected statocyst physiology, as revealed by comparison to dark-conditioned control groups. Readaptation to normal tilt responses occurred at ~20 h following return to Earth. Despite the permanence of gravity, the snail responded in a compensatory manner to its loss and readapted once gravity was restored.",

      "introduction": "Vertebrates and invertebrates sense inertial acceleration and a change in orientation with respect to gravity by mechanoreceptors in the otolith and statolith organs, respectively. The force of gravity is constantly present on Earth and forms the frame of reference for spatial orientation. Inertial accelerations occur within this gravity frame of reference naturally during self-generated movements or those imparted externally onto the organism by perturbations, such as a slippery surface or a deflected leaf. Kreidl (1893) demonstrated in a clever manner that the statocyst is a mechanosensitive organ. As a crayfish molts, it leaves behind the statolith and must manually re-seed its statocyst with a new, typically sand, weight-lending mass. Kreidl replaced the sand with reduced ferrous oxide and manipulated the crayfish's posture using a magnet, thereby simulating the action of the normal gravitational field with a magnetic one. Despite the simplicity of the gastropod organ of balance, there are many functional similarities between the snail's statocyst and the more highly evolved otolith organs of vertebrate species (Popova and Boyle, 2015). Statoreceptors, like hair cells in the vertebrate utricle and saccule, are mechanoreceptors that depend on a weight-lending mass to provide a shearing deformation of the underlying ciliary processes to sense position and acceleration with respect to gravity.",
      "methods": "The 2013 Bion-M1 space project was a 30-day orbital research mission operated by the Russian Academy of Sciences, launched on 19th of April (2013) from Baikonur Cosmodrome, Kazakhstan, and landed on 19th of May near Orenburg, Russia. The satellite was pressurized and contained full life support systems to maintain safe temperature, oxygen, and carbon dioxide levels for a wide variety of species. The satellite is under Earth's gravitational pull and is in a state of free fall or microgravity (μG), and thus the objects within the satellite appear to be weightless. Upon return to Earth, the snails were airlifted from the landing site by helicopter to the Orenburg airport, flown by airplane to Moscow, and transported by van to the laboratory, arriving within 13 h after landing.",
      "results": "When the platform upon which the snail is attached is suddenly pitched from horizontal to vertical, the snail displays a fear-like reaction by fully or partially withdrawing its tentacles (designed phase 0; Figure 1A). This reaction (latency of withdrawal is <1 s) is believed mediated by the gravi-sensing statocyst organ, the snail's equivalent to a vertebrate's vestibular otolith organ. Therefore, the differences in magnitude and time (duration) of the resulting tentacle elongation phase likely reveal changes in reaction of the snail's statocyst.",
      "discussion": "Upon entry into orbit the satellite is in a constant free fall back toward Earth and the traveler feels weightless. The neural gravity sensors that control normal balance and equilibrium are now forced to operate in a unique environment. The present experiments sought to identify the consequences of a 30-day orbital mission on the behavioral performance of snails challenged by a vestibular perturbation after return to normal 1G starting 14–15 h after landing."
