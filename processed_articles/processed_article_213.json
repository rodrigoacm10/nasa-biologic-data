      "introduction": "Skeletal adaptation to microgravity is a physiological obstacle that may limit prolonged space exploration [1].",
      "methods": "Experimental protocols conformed to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, and were approved by the Institutional and Animal Care and Use Committee of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).",
      "results": "Comparing murine calvariae, BV/TV was increased (p<0.05) from a mean of 9.64 ±0.79% (Mean ± SD) in the ground control group to 10.48 ±0.47% in the spaceflight group (Fig. 4A).",
      "discussion": "Our data support the hypothesis that microgravity causes adaptive growth of murine skull bone, reflected by changes in bone volume and possibly bone mineral density."
