    "abstract": "Microbiome analyses of low-biomass samples are challenging because of contamination and inefficiencies, leading many investigators to employ low-throughput methods with minimal controls.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Many emerging applications of the microbiome, ranging from forensics to medicine to optimization of the cleanliness of facilities where sensitive components are assembled, require analysis of low-biomass samples.",
      "methods": "An isolate of B. subtilis 3610 cultivated at 37°C overnight was sorted by flow cytometry on a Sony SH800Z FACS by using SYBR green fluorescence, isolating 5, 50, 500, or 5,000 cells in a sterile 0.22-µm-filtered phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution.",
      "results": "We benchmarked several different high-throughput commercial DNA extraction and bead cleanup techniques and compared them to single-tube extractions by processing negative and positive controls.",
      "discussion": "The KatharoSeq protocol integrates positive and negative controls, specific choices of high-throughput DNA extraction and bead cleanup kits, library construction and pooling strategies for amplicon sequencing or shotgun metagenomics, and bioinformatic sample exclusion protocols to achieve a high-throughput, sensitive, and specific method of probing low-biomass microbiomes."

KatharoSeq incorporates positive and negative controls to reveal the whole bacterial community from inputs of as few as 50 cells and correctly identifies 90.6% of the reads from 500 cells.",
