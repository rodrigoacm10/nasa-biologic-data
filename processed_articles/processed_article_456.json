      "methods": "Heparin Sodium Injection, USP was purchased in two different formulations for human intranasal administration: 5000 USP units per mL (NDC: 71288–403-10) and 10,000 USP units per mL (NDC: 00409–2721-30).",
      "results": "Varying doses of heparin or vehicle control were administered to the nasal cavities of male and female mice once per day for 14 consecutive days to monitor safety and tolerability with this route of administration.",
      "discussion": "Our results demonstrated that UFH produces no local nor systemic adverse effects when administered intranasally to either mice or human volunteers."
