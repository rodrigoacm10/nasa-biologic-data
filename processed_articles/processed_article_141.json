      "introduction": "The increasing duration of space missions and consequent need to adapt to the inhospitable conditions of the space environment present new challenges to astronauts.",
      "methods": "A homogeneous population of NSCs was obtained from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPS).",
      "results": "We performed metabolomic analysis on the culture medium from control Earth-grounded NSCs (GC-NSCs; 1 G) and space-flown NSCs (SPC-NSCs; 0 G).",
      "discussion": "Our aim is to investigate the adaptive changes that Central Nervous System (CNS) cells experience in a µG environment."
