    "sections": {
      "introduction": "A clean and reliable source of water is critical for human spaceflight. With increases in the duration of crewed mission onboard the International Space Station (ISS), the practice of manifesting water, implemented during the Shuttle Program, has become insufficient to meet water demands.",
      "methods": "The ISS UPA flex lines assessed included the recycled brine line (UPA 95” flex line 96 M 12561- 099 [UPA95]), which was installed in February 2010, and the purge line (UPA 115” flex line 96 M 12561- 100 [UPA115]) installed in May 2015.",
      "results": "Three bacteria and one fungus were recovered from UPA95, while six bacteria and two fungi were recovered from UPA115, as detailed in Table 1.",
      "discussion": "The WRS has been providing potable water to astronauts onboard the ISS since 2009. However, our current understanding of the microbial community within the system is limited to the WPA wastewater tank and point-of-use PWD samples."

The results showed that the UPA harbors a unique microbial community, including Burkholderia, Paraburkholderia, and Leifsonia species. The study also found that the UPA flex lines are ideal candidate areas for investigating horizontal gene transfer.",
