      "introduction": "Space exploration is one of the most fascinating enterprises for humans. It is becoming increasingly evident that plants are an essential companion of humans in space exploration as a privileged source of high quality nutrients and oxygen as well as waste recycling systems, that is, as a key component of bioregenerative life support systems (Fu et al., 2016). Thus, the search for the most efficient way of cultivating plants in space, including the knowledge of the mechanisms of adaptation of plants to the space environment and the careful selection of plant species, varieties and genetic lines, are current major challenges of plant space research (Medina et al., 2021). The most difficult parameter to overcome in the space environment is altered gravity level, because all other parameters such as oxygen and nutrient levels, humidity, temperature, or light conditions can be adjusted. Only cosmic radiation represents a challenge comparable to gravity because of the lack of 100% effective protective shields. On the other hand, plants, like every organism on Earth, have evolved under a constant gravity level and its modification or absence may be a difficult challenge to overcome for an organism.",

      "discussion": "In the last decade, the landscape of plant biology research in spaceflight and simulated microgravity research has greatly advanced, mostly with the incorporation of space transcriptomics tools such as RNAseq and microarrays. The aim of this review was therefore to revise the knowledge acquired through these techniques. The focus and organization of the work around the hardware used in the various experiments facilitated the comparison of the numerous results obtained and made it possible the identification of gene expression networks leading to a better knowledge of the plant adaptation mechanisms to spaceflight conditions. The report also highlighted the European contribution in the acquisition of this knowledge."
