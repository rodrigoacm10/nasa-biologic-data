      "introduction": "After a 16-year hiatus, Russia resumed in 2013 its program of biomedical research in space, with the successful 30-day flight of the Bion-M 1 biosatellite (April 19–May 19, 2013), a specially designed automated spacecraft dedicated to life-science experiments.",
      "methods": "Experiments were performed with C57BL/6N male mice.",
      "results": "In the flight (SF) experiment 16 out of 45 mice (36%) survived and in the ground control (GC) experiment, 38 out of 45 mice (84%) survived.",
      "discussion": "The overall success was evident: aggressive interactions were noted on single occasions and under conditions of starvation only."
