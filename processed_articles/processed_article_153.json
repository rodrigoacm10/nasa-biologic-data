      "methods": "Arabidopsis thaliana wild ecotype Columbia (Col-0, CS70000) seed stock, and T-DNA insertion lines for the spr1 (CS6547 – Col-0 background) and sku5 (CS16268 – WS background), were acquired from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (ABRC) (arabidopsis.org; Lamesch et al., 2011).",

      "discussion": "The discovery that root skewing was not gravity-dependent, and prevalent in both light-grown and dark-grown plants in spaceflight habitats (Millar et al., 2011; Paul et al., 2012a; Nakashima et al., 2014), invited questions about the underlying mechanisms of this behavior in the microgravity environment and the relationship between those mechanisms and physiological adaptation to spaceflight."
