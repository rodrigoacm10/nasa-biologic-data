    "abstract": "Animal models are useful for exploring the health consequences of prolonged spaceflight. Capabilities were developed to perform experiments in low earth orbit with on-board sample recovery, thereby avoiding complications caused by return to Earth.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Space travel over the past five decades reveals that multiple organ systems are influenced by novel environmental conditions above the Earth’s surface.",
      "methods": "The Rodent Research Transporter and Habitats performed as expected for the duration of the flight.",
      "results": "Mice flown on the RR-1 mission were designated as either NASA “Validation” mice (Female C57BL/6J, 16 wks) or ISS National Lab “Experimental” mice (Female C57BL/6NTac, 32 wks) to achieve the main objectives.",
      "discussion": "The main objective of this work was to develop new capability for conducting long duration, rodent experiments in space which both minimize the complications of non-specific, chronic stress responses and allow for sample recovery on-orbit,"
