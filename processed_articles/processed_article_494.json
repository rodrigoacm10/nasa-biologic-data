    "abstract": "In C. elegans, unc-89 encodes a set of giant multi-domain proteins (up 8,081 residues) localized to the M-lines of muscle sarcomeres and required for normal sarcomere organization and whole-animal locomotion.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "C. elegans UNC-89 is the founding member of the UNC-89/obscurin family of giant muscle proteins. Loss-of-function mutations in the C. elegans gene unc-89 result in slow moving worms with disorganized muscle sarcomeres, including a lack of M-lines [1–3].",
      "methods": "A cDNA encoding a 571 amino acid portion of the interkinase region of UNC-89, IYDYLRIQ…ADIEKVTP (residues 6945—7515 in UNC-89b) was synthesized using E. coli optimal codons and cloned into pUC57 by GenScript USA,. Inc. (Piscataway, New Jersey).",
      "results": "To examine the nature of the IK regions of UNC-89, obscurin and SPEG in greater detail, we used JPred to predict secondary structure [30]. As shown in Supplemental Figure 2, and in Fig. 1B, there are only short stretches of α-helix (15, 9, 9, 11, 7 and 7 amino acids, from N- to C-terminus of IK), and even fewer and shorter instances of β-strands (3, 2, 3, 4 and 6 amino acids).",
      "discussion": "In this study, we explored the biophysical properties and in vivo function of an example of ~600 aa sequence that has similar features (low sequence complexity, lack of predicted domains and minimal levels of predicted secondary structure elements) and location between two protein kinase domains in the UNC-89/obscurin class of giant muscle proteins."

    "insights_summary": "By single molecule force spectroscopy, the ~645 residue non-domain region lying between the two protein kinase domains of UNC-89 behaves as an elastic random coil. Nematodes lacking this non-domain region have disorganized sarcomeres and reduced whole animal locomotion and force generation. UNC-89 non-domain region is required for proper assembly or stability of A-bands from thick filaments.",
