    "abstract": "Among the many stressors astronauts are exposed to during spaceflight, cosmic radiation may lead to various serious health effects. Specifically, space radiation may contribute to decreased immunity, which has been documented in astronauts during short- and long-duration missions, as evidenced by several changes in cellular immunity and plasma cytokine levels.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "In the space environment, astronauts are exposed to multiple stressors such as isolation, confinement, variable gravitational forces, increased radiation, psychosocial stressors, sleep deprivation, noise, physical exertion, deconditioning, and anxiety [1].",
      "methods": "The current study was approved and sponsored under Research Opportunities in Space Biology Solicitation: NNH12ZTT002N: Proposal Number: 12-12GB_Step2-0014.",
      "results": "We sought to identify any increase in transcription of EBV lytic genes following treatment of Akata cells (that contain a latent EBV episome) with gamma irradiation (as described in the Materials and Methods sections).",
      "discussion": "We studied the effect of four different types of radiation (137Cs gamma rays, 150-MeV protons, 600 MeV/n carbon ions, and 600 MeV/n iron ions) on induction of lytic gene transcription and reactivation of EBV in a latently infected cell line, their cell size and viability at doses of 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 Gy."
