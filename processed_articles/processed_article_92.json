    "abstract": "Obesity is characterized by an increased recruitment of proinflammatory macrophages to the adipose tissue (AT), leading to systemic inflammation and metabolic disease. The pathogenesis of this AT inflammation, however, remains to be elucidated. The circulating adipokine leptin is increased in obesity and is involved in immune cell function and activation. In the present study, we investigated the role of leptin in the induction of obesity-associated inflammation.",

      "methods": "Five-week-old WT male C57BL/6J recipient mice, 10-week-old male WT, and db/db donor mice on the C57BL/6J background were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. Mice were subjected to whole-body irradiation with a single 10-Gy dose from a 137Cs Î³-source.",
      "results": "We generated bone marrow chimeric mice, reconstituted with either WT or db/db bone marrow, to investigate whether leptin signaling is involved in ATM recruitment and promotion of a proinflammatory condition in AT.",
      "discussion": "Our findings establish a novel mechanism involved in the regulation of obesity-associated systemic inflammation and support the hypothesis that leptin is a proinflammatory cytokine."
