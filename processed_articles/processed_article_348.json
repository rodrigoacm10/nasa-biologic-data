    "abstract": "The effect of Bacillus subtilis exposure to the human spaceflight environment on growth, mutagenic frequency, and spectrum of mutations to rifampicin resistance (RifR) was investigated.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "In contrast to the classical view that mutations are random, a growing body of evidence indicates that exposure to environmental stresses in microbes can alter both the mutation rate and the mutagenic spectrum, supplying an increased variety of mutational outputs for selection to operate on and hence shaping the evolutionary trajectory of organisms (Nicholson and Maughan, 2002; Foster, 2007; Nicholson and Park, 2015; Maharjan and Ferenci, 2017b).",
      "methods": "The strain used was Bacillus subtilis strain 168 (trpC2) from the authorsâ€™ laboratory collection.",
      "results": "Viable cell counts were determined for both FL and GC samples recovered from the BRIC-18 and BRIC-21 experiments (Figure 1).",
      "discussion": "In this communication we describe the results of two spaceflight experiments using B. subtilis in which growth, the frequency of mutation to RifR, and the corresponding spectrum of mutations within the RifR regions of the rpoB gene, were measured."
