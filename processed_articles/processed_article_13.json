    "abstract": "The Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor SYP41 is involved in vesicle fusion at the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and interacts with AtVPS45, SYP61, and VTI12. These proteins are involved in diverse cellular processes, including vacuole biogenesis and stress tolerance. A previously uncharacterized protein, named TNO1 (for TGN-localized SYP41-interacting protein), was identified by coimmunoprecipitation as a SYP41-interacting protein. TNO1 was found to localize to the TGN by immunofluorescence microscopy. A tno1 mutant showed increased sensitivity to high concentrations of NaCl, KCl, and LiCl and also to mannitol-induced osmotic stress. Localization of SYP61, which is involved in the salt stress response, was disrupted in the tno1 mutant. Vacuolar proteins were partially secreted to the apoplast in the tno1 mutant, suggesting that TNO1 is required for efficient protein trafficking to the vacuole. The tno1 mutant had delayed formation of the brefeldin A (BFA) compartment in cotyledons upon application of BFA, suggesting less efficient membrane fusion processes in the mutant. Unlike most TGN proteins, TNO1 does not relocate to the BFA compartment upon BFA treatment. These data demonstrate that TNO1 is involved in vacuolar trafficking and salt tolerance, potentially via roles in vesicle fusion and in maintaining TGN structure or identity.",

      "results": "SYP41 is a t-SNARE at the TGN that is required for vesicle fusion in Arabidopsis and forms a complex with VTI12, SYP61, and AtVPS45 (Bassham and Raikhel, 2000; Chen et al., 2005). To identify additional SYP41-interacting proteins, detergent-solubilized membrane extracts of Arabidopsis suspension cells were immunoprecipitated using SYP41 antibody. Proteins that coimmunoprecipitated with SYP41, or with preimmune antibody as a control, were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver staining. Four bands corresponding to proteins migrating at approximately 200, 67, 35, and 15 kD were found only in the SYP41 precipitate and were not present in the SYP41 preimmune precipitate, suggesting that they specifically interacted with SYP41 (Fig. 1A).",
      "discussion": "TNO1 was identified as a novel protein that coimmunoprecipitates with SYP41. As SYP41 is a t-SNARE residing at the TGN, we hypothesize that TNO1 may also be involved in vesicle fusion at this organelle. We have demonstrated that TNO1 is involved in salt and osmotic stress responses and is required for efficient vacuolar trafficking. Based on the effects of BFA treatment, TNO1 is proposed to be involved in the formation of the BFA compartment and may function in maintaining TGN structure or identity.",
      "materials and methods": "Protein extracts were made essentially as described by Bassham et al. (2000) and Sanderfoot et al. (2001a). Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) suspension cells were ground in extraction buffer (phosphate-buffered saline [PBS], 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% [v/v] Triton X-100) and solubilized for 2 h at 4°C. Solubilized proteins were added to a column containing immobilized SYP41 antibodies or SYP41 preimmune serum and incubated for 2 h at 4°C. The columns were washed five times with extraction buffer, and bound proteins were eluted using 0.2 m Gly, pH 2.5. Immunoprecipitates from SYP41 and preimmune antibody were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized using silver staining.",
