    "abstract": "Candida albicans is a commensal yeast that is a common component of the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiome of humans. C. albicans has been shown to bloom in the GI tract of individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD) and can promote and increase the severity of alcoholic liver disease (ALD). However, the effects of C. albicans blooms on the host in the context of AUD or AUD-related phenotypes, such as ethanol preference, have been unstudied.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Candida albicans is a commensal fungus that is found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of roughly 65% of individuals (1). C. albicans is an opportunistic pathogen that can cause oral thrush and life-threatening bloodstream infections (2,3).",
      "methods": "Five-week-old female or male C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Laboratory) were acclimated to the facility and single-housing for 4â€“5 days with scruffing to acclimate to handling.",
      "results": "Mice were orally inoculated with C. albicans as described (25). We previously showed that inoculation did not result in significant changes in bacterial microbiota composition and did not evoke significant inflammation (25).",
      "discussion": "We demonstrate that C. albicans-colonization in mice reduces ethanol preference and consumption. Our results with EP1/EP2 antagonists show that PGE2 signaling plays a significant role in modifying mouse ethanol preference."
