    "abstract": "Scientific access to spaceflight and especially the International Space Station has revealed that physiological adaptation to spaceflight is accompanied or enabled by changes in gene expression that significantly alter the transcriptome of cells in spaceflight.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Most multicellular organisms have specialized organs, structures, cells, and signaling pathways dedicated to sensing their environment, such as the gravity-sensing columella cells found in the plant root tip (Sato et al., 2015).",
      "methods": "When a cell transitions from Earth to orbit, it responds and begins to adjust its metabolism to the stimuli offered by the new environment.",
      "results": "Microarray gene expression data were analyzed using a two-part comparative approach.",
      "discussion": "The gene Arg1 was found to have a dramatic influence on the gene expression profiles that define physiological adaptation of cell cultures to spaceflight."
