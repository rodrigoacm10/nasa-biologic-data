      "introduction": "Recent studies indicate astronauts in low-Earth orbit (LEO), such as on the International Space Station (ISS), experience immune dysfunction, for instance, redox imbalance, elevated inflammation, elevated granulocytes, inhibited lymphocyte proliferation, and reduced lymphocyte functions (Crucian et al., 2015; Douda et al., 2015; Leliefeld et al., 2016; Martinez et al., 2015; Mehta et al., 2017; Pecaut et al., 2017). However, less is known about the likely biological (immune system) consequences of deep space exploration.",
      "methods": "All methods can be found in the accompanying Transparent Methods supplemental file.",
      "results": "Mice were exposed to acute, 0.5-Gy simplified GCR simulation (GCR sim), 1-Gy SPE simulation (SPE sim), or 5Gy gamma irradiation, singly or in combination with HU (14-days total) and were weighed on days −3, 0, 7, and 14 (Figure 1A).",
      "discussion": "Utilizing the recently developed simplified version of the NASA consensus formula of five different ions to simulate GCR and SPE irradiation at NSRL, our study sought to investigate the immediate-early immune effects following acute simulated deep space exposures of ionizing irradiation, singly or in combination with simulated microgravity in mice."
