    "abstract": "Spaceflight is a unique environment with profound effects on biological systems including tissue redistribution and musculoskeletal stresses. However, the more subtle biological effects of spaceflight on cells and organisms are difficult to measure in a systematic, unbiased manner.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Physical effects of microgravity during spaceflight can often be described by equations that allow their quantification [1, 2]. For example, microgravity has well-defined effects on sedimentation in association with reduced terminal velocity and shear in suspension culture [3] and reduced gravity-dependent convection of gases [4]. Biological effects of spaceflight on cells and organisms, on the other hand, are much harder to define [1, 2].",
      "methods": "The Opticell Processing Module, described below, was used to perform a series of ~21 generation pooled growth experiments on two yeast deletion collections: (i) ~4800 homozygous strains and (ii) ~5900 heterozygous strains (including ~1100 single-copy deletions of essential genes), each carrying unique DNA barcodes that act as strain identifiers.",
      "results": "We assessed the yeast deletion collection samples for patterns of strain sensitivity in the following manner: barcode counts for each strain in each sample were measured and normalized as described in Methods.",
      "discussion": "The experiments presented here represent a proof of principle for conducting full genome environmental screens in spaceflight using robust hardware that can recapitulate a full automation suite with environmental control in the space of a small suitcase."
