    "abstract": "This study is a repeated measures design to measure the lumbar spine’s response to common backpack loads in children with idiopathic low back pain (ILBP) using upright MRI.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Among schoolchildren between the ages of 11 and 14 years, the incidence of low back pain is between 24 and 37%. In school children, risk factors for low back pain include female gender, poorer general health, high levels of physical activity, time spent sitting, backpack loads, and a family history of back pain.",
      "methods": "We employed a repeated measures design to measure the lumbar spine’s response to typical school backpack loads in children with ILBP. A 0.6T upright MRI scanner (FONAR Upright MRI, Melville, NY) imaged the lumbar spine.",
      "results": "In children with ILBP, the 4 kg and 8 kg backpacks significantly compressed the L5-S1 disc height in relation to standing by 1.0 ± 0.2 mm (9.8 ± 3.7 % and 9.9 ± 3.0 %, respectively; p = 0.033 and p = 0.007, respectively).",
      "discussion": "In children with ILBP, increasing backpack loads only compress the L5-S1 disc, while in healthy children the same loads compress all the lumbar discs and to a greater extent for most lumbar discs."

    "insights_summary": "This study found that children with idiopathic low back pain experience altered disc compression in response to backpack loads compared to healthy children. The results suggest that children with ILBP may alter the distribution of backpack load from the intervertebral discs to the surrounding paraspinal musculature through a 'splinting' effect, leading to muscle fatigue and pain.",
