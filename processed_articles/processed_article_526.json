    "abstract": "The first global genomic, proteomic, and secondary metabolomic characterization of the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans following growth onboard the International Space Station (ISS) is reported.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "It has been well documented that fungal populations persist in extreme conditions, such as various temperatures and pH (López-Archilla et al. 2001; Amaral Zettler et al. 2002; Onofri et al. 2007; de Crecy et al. 2009; Gunde-Cimerman et al. 2009), desiccation (Barnard et al. 2013), ionizing radiation (Dadachova and Casadevall 2008; Tkavc et al. 2018), Mars-like conditions (de la Torre Noetzel et al. 2018; Onofri et al. 2018a; Onofri et al. 2018b), and the spacecraft environment (Onofri et al. 2008; Checinska et al. 2015).",
      "methods": "The WT A. nidulans FGSC A4 strain was obtained from the Fungal Genetics Stock Center (McCluskey et al. 2010).",
      "results": "To identify genomic alterations occurring in A. nidulans strains in response to ISS conditions, whole genome paired-end sequencing (WGS) was performed on ISS-grown samples and ground-grown control strains, which were subjected to growth for 7 days.",
      "discussion": "This study revealed that the spacecraft environment alters the A. nidulans genome in specific regions."
