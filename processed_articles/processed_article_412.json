    "abstract": "The motion of cells orthogonal to the direction of main flow is of importance in natural and engineered systems. The lateral movement of red blood cells (RBCs) distal to sudden expansion is considered to influence the formation and progression of thrombosis in venous valves, aortic aneurysms, and blood-circulating devices and is also a determining parameter for cell separation applications in flow-focusing microfluidic devices.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Red blood cells (RBCs) or erythrocytes are the most abundant cells in blood with 5 × 109 cells/ml accounting for 40%–50% (known as hematocrit or HCT) by volume in a healthy individual.",
      "methods": "The experimental system consisted of an infusion pump for positive pressure driven flow through the microfluidic chip, which was mounted on a microscope objective for the visualization of both RBC distribution and μPIV (Fig. 1).",
      "results": "We perfused a 5% hematocrit (HCT) suspension through the valve at the channel Reynolds (Re) numbers of 0.6, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24.",
      "discussion": "In summary, we have shown that vortical flows in microchannels of geometry similar to venous valve pockets result in anomalous local RBC distribution, which can be significantly different from the feed or bulk hematocrit."
