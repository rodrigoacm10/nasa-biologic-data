    "abstract": "Here we demonstrate that human neural stem cells (NSCs) proliferate while in space and they express specific NSC markers after being in space. NSCs displayed both higher oxygen consumption and glycolysis than ground controls. These cells also kept their ability to become young neurons.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "The long-term effects of the space environment on the central nervous system (CNS) still remain largely unknown. Human space travelers experience a unique environment that affects homeostasis and physiological adaptation.",
      "methods": "NSCs were derived from induced pluripotent stem cells. The original cells, known as “CS83iCTR-33nxx” (such as skin cells or lymphoblasts), were “reprogrammed” and provided to us by the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center via a material transfer agreement.",
      "results": "This experiment was designed to ascertain the proliferation of NSCs solely while in microgravity. In order to elucidate if NSCs in “space microgravity” proliferate, we used the Type IV automated experiment insert from Kiwi (Airbus, Friedrichshafen, DE), allowing for a fresh medium change twice during space travel.",
      "discussion": "Here we have demonstrated that human NSCs proliferate while in space and that they remain as NSCs after 39.3 days unattended, in the same culture medium, and in space microgravity."
