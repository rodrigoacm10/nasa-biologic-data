      "introduction": "Space exploration will soon include new human missions to the Moon as a first step in the human exploration of Mars. Recent studies in human (i.e., NASA Twin Study, Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019) and mammalian systems (rodent missions, Beheshti et al., 2019; Ronca et al., 2019) are paving the way to understand the effects of the microgravity environment on human physiology, but human life in space will rely on the essential role of plants in bioregenerative life support systems (Zabel et al., 2016), not only as a source of water, food, and removal of CO2 but also by providing a terrestrial-like environment for the psychological well-being of astronauts.",
      "methods": "All methods can be found in the accompanying Transparent Methods supplemental file.",
      "results": "Two environmental conditions (light) are compared here, both of them as part of the SG Earth control reference experiment using the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS). Seedlings were germinated in the same spaceflight hardware during 4 days with a day/night cycle of illumination, and then half of the samples were exposed to 2 days of darkness and the other group to 2 days of continuous red light (Figure 1A).",
      "discussion": "Major constraints of spaceflight experiments are the reduced amount of material and reproducibility, but other issues include the storage of samples before and after the experiment execution in space, causing staggered preparation and processing of the samples (Millar et al., 2010; Correll et al., 2013)."
