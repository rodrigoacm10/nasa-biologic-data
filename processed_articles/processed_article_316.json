    "abstract": "Polyamines, including cadaverine, are organic cations that affect numerous biological processes including transcription, translation, cell signalling, and ion channel activity. They often function in biotic and abiotic stress responses in plants. Because little is known about how plants respond to cadaverine, a quantitative natural variation approach was used to identify genetic factors that contribute to this response.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Polyamines are organic cations that are prevalent in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Putrescine, spermidine, and spermine are the most common polyamines in plants, although thermospermine and cadaverine have also been found in many species including Arabidopsis thaliana (Shevyakova et al., 2001; Knott et al., 2007).",
      "methods": "QTL analysis used the following stocks from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (Columbus, OH, USA): Cape Verde Islands (Cvi; CS8580), Landsberg erecta-2 Ler-2; CS8581), and a population of Cvi/Ler recombinant inbred lines (RILs; CS22000).",
      "results": "Arabidopsis accessions show varying root length inhibition responses to exogenous cadaverine. (A) Seedlings were grown vertically for 3 d and then at a 30 ° backward tilt for another 3 d. Average root length on control medium was set to 1.",
      "discussion": "It was found that Arabidopsis roots exhibited varying responses to exogenously applied cadaverine depending on the accession."
