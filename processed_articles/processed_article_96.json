B lymphocytes express highly specific and highly diversified receptors, known as immunoglobulins (Ig), that directly bind and neutralize pathogens.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Spaceflight presents a unique set of challenges to the immune system. For example, spaceflight alters T- and B-lymphocyte functions, including recall responses in astronauts aboard the space shuttle and cytokine responses after missions to the international space station (ISS) (Berry, 1970, Crucian et al., 2013, Crucian et al., 2014b, Grigoriev et al., 1993, Stein and Schluter, 1994, Taylor and Dardano, 1983, Taylor et al., 1986, Rykova et al., 2008).",
      "methods": "RNA samples were provided by the NASA Ames Research Center. RNA was extracted from the spleen and liver of 35-week-old female C57BL/6Tac mice that were either housed in the ISS environmental simulator (ground control, n=5), or flown aboard the ISS via SpaceX-4 (n=5).",
      "results": "B cells originate in the bone marrow from hematopoietic precursors, traffic through the periphery and enter the spleen where they are further selected and mature (Loder et al., 1999).",
      "discussion": "Spaceflight and ground-based analog models induce phenotypic and functional changes in T- and B- lymphocyte populations. Spaceflight also affects bone marrow, the site of B-cell differentiation and development."
