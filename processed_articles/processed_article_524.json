      "introduction": "Enterobacter species are facultative anaerobic, Gram-stain-negative, and saprophytic microorganisms found in soil, sewage, and as a commensal enteric flora of the human gastrointestinal tract [1]. They have been associated with nosocomial infection in humans, causing bacteremia, endocarditis, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, skin and soft tissue infections, lower respiratory tract, urinary tract, and intra-abdominal infections [2, 3].",
      "methods": "Sample collection from ISS environmental surfaces, processing, cultivation of bacteria were already reported [9]. When 105 bacterial strains isolated from various ISS locations were analyzed for their phylogenetic affiliations, five isolates were identified as Enterobacter bugandensis.",
      "results": "The ISS strains showed aerobic, motile, rod shape, Gram stain negative characteristics; colonies were pale yellow in color, formed within 24–36 h at 35 °C on R2A, TSA, and blood agar.",
      "discussion": "In summary, a comparative phenotypic and genotypic analyses of ISS isolates identified as E. bugandensis were carried out."
