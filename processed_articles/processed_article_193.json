    "abstract": "The mechanisms triggering disuse muscle atrophy remain of debate. It is becoming evident that mitochondrial dysfunction may regulate pathways controlling muscle mass.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "The molecular mechanisms that govern the imbalance between pathways controlling protein synthesis and degradation in disuse muscle atrophy remain unclear, notwithstanding the large amount of work done (Bonaldo & Sandri, 2013).",
      "methods": "Experiments were approved by the Italian Health Department and complied with the Italian guidelines for the use of laboratory animals, which conform to the European Community Directive published in 1986 (86/609/ECC).",
      "results": "Gastrocnemius muscle fibres went through 14 and 12% of atrophy, respectively, at 3 and 7 days of HU (Fig.1).",
      "discussion": "Although several studies have attempted to elucidate the signalling pathways involved in triggering atrophy during disuse of limb muscles, the exact mechanisms responsible for disuse-induced muscular atrophy are currently debated and there is still no therapy to treat muscle atrophy."
