    "abstract": "Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a multifaceted and gradually advancing condition characterized by a complex pathogenesis. The current therapeutic options for CKD remain limited in efficacy. Consequently, the identification and exploration of novel drug targets for CKD are of paramount importance.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a progressive condition affecting over 800 million individuals globally. It is defined by a persistent estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of less than 60 mL/min/1.73 mÂ² body surface area, or urinary albumin excretion equal to or greater than 30 mg/day, or both, sustained for a duration exceeding three months.",
      "methods": "In this MR analysis, we selected cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTL) of druggable genes as the exposure variable and employed genome-wide association study (GWAS) data for CKD from the FinnGen database as the outcome variable.",
      "results": "We employed the IVW method as the primary analytical approach. Sixteen druggable genes exhibited a strong association with the development of CKD at a FDR of less than 0.05.",
      "discussion": "In this study, we found that the expression of 12 genes was closely related to CKD. For genes demonstrating significant associations in the MR analysis, we performed a comprehensive suite of sensitivity analyses and functional assessments."
