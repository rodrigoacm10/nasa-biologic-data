    "abstract": "Future multi-year crewed planetary missions will motivate advances in aerospace nutrition and telehealth. On Earth, the Human Cell Atlas project aims to spatially map all cell types in the human body. Here, we propose that a parallel Human Cell Space Atlas could serve as an openly available, global resource for space life science research. As humanity becomes increasingly spacefaring, high-resolution omics on orbit could permit an advent of precision spaceflight healthcare. Alongside the scientific potential, we consider the complex ethical, cultural, and legal challenges intrinsic to the human space omics discipline, and how philosophical frameworks may benefit from international perspectives.",

      "introduction": "Humanity may be on the brink of establishing a new era of interplanetary space exploration that would witness crewed missions beyond low-Earth orbit (LEO) and a growing commercial spaceflight sector that would prompt a wider health range of individuals entering space compared to the selective cohorts of distinctively fit professional astronauts from previous generations. Numerous space organizations across the globe openly aspire toward landing humans on Mars in the coming decades, underscoring an overall international interest in what may be the next stage of human space exploration.",
