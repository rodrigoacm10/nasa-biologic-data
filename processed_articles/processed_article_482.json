    "abstract": "Bone marrow adipose tissue (BMAT) levels are higher in distal femur metaphysis of female mice housed at thermoneutral (32°C) than in mice housed at 22°C, as are abdominal white adipose tissue (WAT) mass, and serum leptin levels.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Bone marrow adipose tissue (BMAT) is a fat depot spatially confined within the skeleton. The resident adipocytes are derived primarily from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells.",
      "methods": "The experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Oregon State University in accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.",
      "results": "The effects of leptin supplementation and pair feeding on food intake, body composition, serum leptin, and Ucp1 gene expression in BAT are shown in Figure 2.",
      "discussion": "In the present study, we observed a reciprocal relationship between bone formation rate (increased) and BMAT levels (decreased) in distal femur of B6 mice following leptin supplementation."
