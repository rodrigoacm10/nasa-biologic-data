    "abstract": "The principal nutrient artery to the femur demonstrates an increase in nitric oxide mediated vasodilation in rats after treadmill exercise training. The present study sought to determine whether exercise training improves hindlimb bone and marrow blood flow distribution at rest and during exercise.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Improvements in both bone and cardiovascular health due to regular exercise participation are well established (11, 18, 24, 30). In addition, the onset of age-related decreases in bone mineral density can be delayed by regular exercise to enhance bone accrual during skeletal growth and maintenance (30).",
      "methods": "All experimental procedures were approved by the University of Florida’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and conformed to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the U.S. National Institutes of Health (Eight edition, 2011).",
      "results": "Body mass of SED animals (461 ± 18 g) was greater (P<0.05) than that of ET animals (406 ± 8 g). MAP at rest (SED: 161 ± 8, ET: 160 ± 4 mmHg) and during exercise (SED: 166 ± 5, ET: 160 ± 5 mmHg) were not different between groups.",
      "discussion": "Exercise training has been previously shown to improve endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the femoral PNA (12), one of the primary resistance arteries that regulates bone and marrow perfusion in the femur (6)."
