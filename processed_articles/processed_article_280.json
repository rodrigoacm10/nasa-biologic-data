    "abstract": "Aims: Redox homeostasis is critical in regulating the fate and function of multipotent cells in the central nervous system (CNS). Here, we investigated whether low dose charged particle irradiation could elicit oxidative stress in neural stem and precursor cells and whether radiation-induced changes in redox metabolism would coincide with cognitive impairment. Results: Low doses (<1 Gy) of charged particles caused an acute and persistent oxidative stress. Early after (<1 week) irradiation, increased levels of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species were generally dose responsive, but were less dependent on dose weeks to months thereafter. Exposure to ion fluences resulting in less than one ion traversal per cell was sufficient to elicit radiation-induced oxidative stress. Whole body irradiation triggered a compensatory response in the rodent brain that led to a significant increase in antioxidant capacity 2 weeks following exposure, before returning to background levels at week 4. Low dose irradiation was also found to significantly impair novel object recognition in mice 2 and 12 weeks following irradiation. Innovation: Data provide evidence that acute exposure of neural stem cells and the CNS to very low doses and fluences of charged particles can elicit a persisting oxidative stress lasting weeks to months that is associated with impaired cognition. Conclusions: Exposure to low doses of charged particles causes a persistent oxidative stress and cognitive impairment over protracted times. Data suggest that astronauts subjected to space radiation may develop a heightened risk for mission critical performance decrements in space, along with a risk of developing long-term neurocognitive sequelae.",

      "introduction": "Travel to space necessitates exposure to radiation fields containing a spectrum of charged particles having different fluences and energies (15). These fully ionized particles range from protons to iron ions and are derived from solar emissions including periodic flares (mainly protons) along with the galactic cosmic rays (High Z and Energy [HZE] particles). Exposure to such radiation poses a risk that will be proportional to the frequency of particle traversals and the radiation quality (i.e., linear energy transfer [LET]) of that particle (6, 20), although for many central nervous system (CNS) endpoints this relationship is overly simplistic. While energetic protons have relatively low LET, HZE particles typically found in space have much larger LET values that depend on the mass and energy of the ion. These highly energetic (MeV-GeV/n) particles can cause significant cellular damage by direct traversal through tissues of the body and via secondary ionizations caused by delta rays emanating from the track core (14, 41).",
      "methods": "Primary neural stem/precursor cells isolated from the mouse subventricular and hippocampal dentate subgranular zones were used for all studies. These cells were grown in DME/F12 (1:1; Invitrogen), supplemented with bovine serum albumin (0.4%; Sigma), insulin (20 μg/ml; Sigma), progesterone (1.59 nM; Sigma), putrescine (7.7 μg/ml; Sigma), sodium selenite (24 nM; Sigma), apo-transferrin (80 μg/ml; Sigma), heparin (0.76 units/ml; Sigma), epidermal growth factor (200 ng/ml; Biomedical Technologies), and fibroblast growth factor (40 ng/ml; Peprotech). Cultures are passaged three times weekly by mechanical trituration and maintained in T25 flasks kept on an orbital shaker at slow rotation (∼50 rpm) in a CO2 (5%) incubator at 37°C and maximum humidity. Over the course of these experiments, cultures were maintained between passages 10–15 before irradiation and then passaged as described until the time of analysis. Under these conditions, cells routinely exhibit doubling times of 20–22 h.",
      "results": "Neurosphere cultures maintained over time contain mixtures of precursor cells derived from much smaller proportions of stem cells. Cell counts made from irradiated cultures measure the proliferative potential of the surviving precursor cell population that predominate the bulk culture. Irradiation of neurosphere cultures reduces the number of cells in a dose-responsive manner, with a D37 of 1.8 Gy in the low dose range (≤2 Gy, Fig. 1, solid line). At higher doses bulk cell counts were less responsive to dose. Sphere formation was surprisingly resistant to charged particle irradiation, as the formation of spheres showed little dependence on the incident dose (Fig. 1, dashed line). While these assays measure different endpoints, data does suggest that neurosphere cultures contain populations of cells with different sensitivities to charged particle irradiation, likely due to the presence of partially committed stem cell progeny at various states of differentiation.",
      "discussion": "Few studies have investigated the effects of charged particles on neural stem and precursor cells exposed to the low ion fluences expected on a space mission outside the earth's magnetosphere (21, 32). Past work from our lab has characterized the radiation response of multipotent neural cells grown as monolayers to high and low LET radiation, and has shown that following irradiation these cells exhibit a marked rise in acute and persistent oxidative stress that is associated with increased apoptosis, an inhibition of cell cycle progression, and marked radiosensitivity (25, 32, 33). Our present study extends past findings by analyzing multipotent neural cells grown as neurospheres that were exposed to varying doses of charged particles. Present studies also placed an emphasis on very low fluences of HZE particles more typical of the actual space radiation environment, and on analysis of cells over protracted postirradiation times to gauge the long-term consequences of charged particle exposure on astronauts."
