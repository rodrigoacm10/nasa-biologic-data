      "introduction": "Neuro-ophthalmic abnormalities have been identified in astronauts. These complex physiological and pathological changes are collectively defined as spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS) [1].",
      "methods": "Ten-week-old C57BL/6 male mice were launched in December 2021, at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on the rodent research-18 (RR-18) mission for 35 days aboard the ISS.",
      "results": "Mice were weighed before launch and shortly before being euthanized after landing. Prior to taking off, the body weights were similar among all groups.",
      "discussion": "Observed changes following spaceflight include increased oxidative damage and increased apoptosis in the mouse retinal nuclear layer and photoreceptors."
