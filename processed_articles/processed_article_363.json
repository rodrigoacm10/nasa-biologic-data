      "introduction": "In vitro cell culture models comprised solely of either epithelial cells or macrophages cultured as monolayers are often used to study Salmonella enterica infections, as both cell types play critical roles in the infection process.",

      "results": "Our previous 3-D model of HT-29 colonic epithelial cells was advanced in this study by the inclusion of U937 monocytes that were pre-differentiated into macrophages by PMA.",
      "discussion": "An improved understanding of the transition between normal intestinal homeostasis and disease caused by enteric pathogens will be facilitated by development of organotypic intestinal cell culture models that mimic the 3-D architecture and multicellular complexity present in the parental tissue in vivo."
