      "introduction": "Growing healthy plants in space is a major goal towards the viability of long-term space missions as plants can provide food for astronauts and benefit mental health. The space environment includes multiple stresses for plant growth including different levels of gravity, radiation, decreased nutrient delivery and water recycling1,2. The International Space Station provides an ideal experimental setting for the study of plant growth and development under space conditions and many experiments have been conducted with plants on the ISS1,3. Reduced gravity on the ISS results in disoriented plant growth unless light is provided to activate directional growth from phototropism. Effects of the spaceflight environment on the ISS include reduced cell elongation4 or altered cell division5 in roots. At the cellular level, the microtubule and actin cytoskeletons as well as the cell wall are altered under microgravity6–8. Other cellular organelles are altered under microgravity conditions include mitochondria, plastids and ER6. Interestingly, vacuole numbers increased in root apical cells for Arabidopsis seedlings grown on the ISS9, and vacuole volume increases in certain cells in microgravity10,11. Moreover, proteins involved in intracellular membrane trafficking were found to show altered abundance in microgravity12–14. Those results suggest vacuolar development as well as trafficking are disrupted in microgravity, but overall, there is a large gap in documenting the effect of spaceflight on the organization of cellular organelles15.",
      "methods": "Arabidopsis ecotype Columbia (Col-0) expressing GFP-TIP2;1 was previously described39 and previously transformed27 with the HDEL-mCherry construct40. The zig-1 mutant was previously described24, and the GFP-TIP2;1 marker was introgressed into this genotype by crossing. The HDEL-mCherry marker40 was separately introduced into zig-1 by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation27 and the two markers were combined by crossing and selection of plants in the F2.",
      "results": "The goal of BRIC-24 was to test whether vacuole fusion is affected by the microgravity environment of the ISS. A previously characterized vacuole fusion assay26,27 was implemented with the BRIC-PDFU hardware. This assay takes advantage of the accumulation of vacuoles in the zig-1 mutant and the rapid induction of vacuole fusion in this mutant upon treatment with Wortmannin (WM)27. Visualization of organelle morphology is accomplished by confocal microscopy of a GFP-tagged vacuolar marker (GFP-TIP2;1)39 and a mCherry-tagged ER marker (HDEL-mCherry)40 previously characterized.",
      "discussion": "Here, we investigated the effect of microgravity on plant vacuole fusion and the association of vacuoles and plastids. The feasibility of chemical treatments in plants on the ISS was demonstrated using the BRIC-PDFU hardware and an optimized plant fixation protocol."
