      "introduction": "The researches and clinical application of otoendoscope in otologic surgery are increasing, which not only expands otologists’ understanding of otologic anatomy and pathophysiology but also provides a new way for the treatment of otologic diseases.",

      "discussion": "Currently, topical vasoconstrictors used in endoscopic surgery include cocaine, oxymetazoline, and epinephrine."
