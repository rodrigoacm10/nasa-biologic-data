    "abstract": "Multiple Arabidopsis arogenate dehydratase (ADT) knock-out (KO) mutants, with phenotypes having variable lignin levels (up to circa 70% reduction), were studied to investigate how differential reductions in ADTs perturb its overall plant systems biology.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Arogenate is an important branch-point to either tyrosine (Tyr) or phenylalanine (Phe) in vascular plants, whose formation from arogenate (Agn) is catalyzed by arogenate dehydrogenase (ADH) and arogenate dehydratase (ADT), respectively (Figure 1).",
      "methods": "Arabidopsis thaliana WT (Columbia) T-DNA insertion lines were obtained from the Salk Institute Genomic Analysis Laboratory (SIGnAL)1. Individual ADT KO mutant lines were created in homozygous form, with individual lines crossed to ultimately provide double, triple, and quadruple homozygous ADT KO mutants (Corea et al., 2012c).",
      "results": "A multi-omics evaluation of Arabidopsis ADT KO mutant lines (compared to WT plants) was conducted at 4 weeks of growth/development, when the plants had fully developed rosette leaves and had stems about 10–20 cm high (∼1/3 height at maturity).",
      "discussion": "In this study, it was found that transcript and protein data between ADT KO mutants correlated well within their own groups (i.e., transcript to transcript or protein to protein comparisons)."
