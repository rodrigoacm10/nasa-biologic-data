      "introduction": "The presence of humans in space has considerably increased since the beginning of space conquest and the space population is expected to continue to grow with tourism and private research activities. The NASA Artemis program plans to take humans back to the Moon for 2024, and a walk on Mars soil is estimated in the course of the 2030s (Bukley, 2020). Meanwhile, space research is driving more and more astronauts in low Earth orbit as an invaluable tool used to deepen humanity’s understanding of the universe and our place within it. But not only do humans want to visit and explore space, humans want to live in space. Outer space settlement has become a new goal of space agencies and the private sector. The Artemis program, SpaceX, the Moon Village Association, and the Mars Society are examples of the driving force of human performance in space. Recently, the USA Air Force Space Command reported eight most plausible scenarios to the year 2060, all of which anticipating a permanent occupation of the Moon surface ranging from a small-sized crew to colony of thousands of people (Air Force Space Command, 2019). Over fifty years after the first foot imprint on the lunar surface, humans could very soon become an interplanetary species.",

      "results": "Lipid metabolic processes are the most commonly biological processes affected in mice quadriceps and liver during spaceflight",
      "discussion": "Despite the systemic and physiological health risk of spaceflight, it is a fact that humans have become a space-faring species. Muscle atrophy has been shown to occur in both weightlessness and bed rest studies. The decreased gravity load on the locomotive apparatus is often presented as the main driver of muscle atrophy and bone loss. Previous studies showed that mitochondrial function and lipid metabolism were impaired in both astronauts and mice during spaceflight. Da Silveira and colleagues previously showed that a mitochondrial stress is a central hub for spaceflight-induced physiological changes (da Silveira et al., 2020)."
