    "abstract": "Investigation into the causes underlying the rapid, global amphibian decline provides critical insight into the effects of changing ecosystems.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "The amphibian decline controversy has focused on many factors that affect amphibian populations to varying degrees [1], including habitat loss and degradation, climate change, pollution, increased ultraviolet B (UV-B) radiation, direct exploitation, introduced species and disease, including infectious disease [2], [3].",
      "methods": "The Ozark Hellbender, C. a. bishopi, is now listed as endangered and populations have been extirpated and face extinction in much of the former range.",
      "results": "Our results reflect our strategy to optimize chances for successful culture of potentially pathogenic microorganisms by using three different media for each sample; blood agar (all purpose growth media), mannitol salts (differential and selective media), Sabouraud's (differential and selective media often used to isolate fungi) (Figure 1).",
      "discussion": "While our microbiological evaluations in this study indicated common environmental organisms in both abnormal/injured and uninjured Ozark Hellbenders, several opportunistic pathogenic organisms were identified that were associated only with the abnormal tissue/injuries of C. a. bishopi,"
