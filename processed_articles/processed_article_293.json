    "abstract": "Under conditions of weightlessness human position sense appears to deteriorate. This was tested, employing three methods of measurement: two-arm matching, one-arm pointing and one-arm repositioning, carried out during parabolic flight.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "The ability to accurately perceive the position of a body part without looking at it, human position sense, is one of the proprioceptive senses, “the senses within”. Proprioception includes the senses of position, movement, force, heaviness, and balance (Proske and Gandevia 2012).",
      "methods": "12 adult participants (1female, 11male) 26–53 years old (M = 37.9 years, ± 8.2 SD), took part in the present study.",
      "results": "As a first step, the data acquired on the ground (preflight session) were analysed.",
      "discussion": "When we embarked on the present study, it was to ask the question, did gravity influence position sense, no matter what method of measurement was used (Weber and Proske 2022)?"
