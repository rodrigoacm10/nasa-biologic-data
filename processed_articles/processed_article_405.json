      "introduction": "As an essential part of life support systems for long-duration space missions, plants supplement food as well as purify the air and water (Fu et al., 2016; De Micco et al., 2023).",
      "methods": "Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 seed stocks were carefully screened to obtain an average germination of ≥99%, and dissection and processing protocols were developed to recover ≥1μg RNA from ≤3mg input tissue with a high degree of RNA integrity.",
      "results": "To minimize the impact of handling and transport, seeds were dry-mounted on membranes and remained dormant until hydration at the initiation of each experimental run.",
      "discussion": "The PS and PRR spaceflight experiments were designed to examine early seedling development and responses to microgravity."
