    "abstract": "Spaceflight is known to affect immune cell populations. In particular, splenic B cell numbers decrease during spaceflight and in ground-based physiological models. Although antibody isotype changes have been assessed during and after space flight, an extensive characterization of the impact of spaceflight on antibody composition has not been conducted in mice. Next Generation Sequencing and bioinformatic tools are now available to assess antibody repertoires. We can now identify immunoglobulin gene-segment usage, junctional regions, and modifications that contribute to specificity and diversity.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "For B cell development and specificity, there are a large number of heavy chain (IgH) and kappa light chain (IgÎº) gene segments that are used to produce the Ig (antibody) receptor population repertoire (de Bono et al., 2004). This antibody repertoire is quite large and the possible specificities can theoretically exceed the number of actual antibody molecules in the host (Georgiou et al., 2014).",
      "methods": "Spleens were removed from four 11-week-old, specific pathogen-free, female C57BL/6J mice housed in the Division of Biology vivarium at Kansas State University.",
      "results": "Total sequence numbers generated were similar among the treatment groups with the cells treatment group resulting in 23.9 million reads, tissue treatment group with 25.9 million, and size selected treatment group with 21.5 million reads.",
      "discussion": "Spaceflight presents unique difficulties in the collection, preparation and preservation of cells and tissues. Normal preparation methods such as the creation of single-cell suspensions are difficult and normal tissue preservations methods such as the use of liquid nitrogen are unavailable."
