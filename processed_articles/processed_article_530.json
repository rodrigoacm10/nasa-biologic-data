    "abstract": "Filamentous fungi have been associated with extreme habitats, including nuclear power plant accident sites and the International Space Station (ISS). Due to their immense adaptation and phenotypic plasticity capacities, fungi may thrive in what seems like uninhabitable niches.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Extremophiles are of interest to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) due to their potential to survive hostile and extraterrestrial conditions (Rummel et al., 2002).",
      "methods": "Subcultures of the isolated strains were obtained from the Institute of Microbiology and Virology, Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, within the framework of a multiyear collaborative research program, to the Center for Environmental Biotechnology at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL).",
      "results": "Twelve fungal strains isolated from Chernobyl nuclear accident sites, belonging to nine genera, and one ISS-isolated strain were included in this study.",
      "discussion": "Although it has been well documented that bacteria are associated with the spacecraft environment (La Duc et al., 2003, 2004; Newcombe et al., 2005), few studies address the persistence of fungi in this environment (La Duc et al., 2012; Weinmaier et al., 2015)."
