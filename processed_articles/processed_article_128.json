    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Coronary blood flow regulation is achieved by multiple regulatory responses of the coronary resistance vasculature, including myogenic vasoconstriction and flow-induced and metabolic vasodilation.",
      "methods": "Young (3–4 mo) and old (20–21 mo) male Fisher 344 rats were obtained from the National Institute on Aging.",
      "results": "Body weight increased with age (Table 1). Exercise training reduced body weight in both young and old rats.",
      "discussion": "Our previous work has shown that myogenic constriction and contractile responses to endothelin are impaired in coronary arterioles with advancing age."
