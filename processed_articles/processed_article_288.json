    "abstract": "Extended spaceflight has been shown to adversely affect astronaut visual acuity. The purpose of this study was to determine whether spaceflight alters gene expression profiles and induces oxidative damage in the retina. Ten week old adult C57BL/6 male mice were flown aboard the ISS for 35 days and returned to Earth alive. Ground control mice were maintained on Earth under identical environmental conditions. Within 38 (+/−4) hours after splashdown, mice ocular tissues were collected for analysis. RNA sequencing detected 600 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in murine spaceflight retinas, which were enriched for genes related to visual perception, the phototransduction pathway, and numerous retina and photoreceptor phenotype categories.",

      "introduction": "We are entering an era of renewed interest in space exploration. Although officially the space race ended decades ago, humanity is crossing the threshold into a second space age that includes new global partnerships and private companies. This new infrastructure and organization has brought the concept of long duration space missions, such as permanent moon settlements and manned missions to Mars, from a distant goal to a tangible reality1. However, the space environment is fundamentally different from Earth. Microgravity and ionizing radiation compose a unique set of physiological stressors, the effects of which remain to be fully characterized2,3.",
      "methods": "SpaceX successfully launched the 12th Commercial Resupply Service (CRS-12) payload at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on a 35-day mission in August, 2017. 10-week-old male C57BL/6 mice (n = 20) (Jackson laboratories, Inc. Bar harbor, ME) were flown for NASA’s ninth Rodent Research experiment (RR-9). The mice lived in NASA’s Rodent Habitats (RH) aboard ISS for 35 days before returning to Earth via SpaceX’s Dragon capsule.",
      "results": "The space environment caused a wide array of changes in gene expression, the most prominent were changes in ocular pathways and RNA processing. Twenty mice spent 35 days on the International Space Station as part of NASA’s ninth Rodent Research experiment (RR-9). An additional twenty mice were housed on Earth in the same housing hardware used in flight for the ground control group. RNA sequencing was performed on sixteen mice (n = 8/group). 600 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between the spaceflight and ground control groups using DESeq211 with an adjusted p-value threshold of 0.01 (Sup. Table 1).",
      "discussion": "We have found a distinct gene expression signature in the retina of mice exposed to the spaceflight environment compared with the ground control. This signature is enriched for genes related to visual perception, the phototransduction pathway, and numerous retina and photoreceptor phenotype categories."
