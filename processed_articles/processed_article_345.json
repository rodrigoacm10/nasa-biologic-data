    "abstract": "Bacteria of the genus Staphylococcus are persistent inhabitants of human spaceflight habitats and represent potential opportunistic pathogens. The effect of the human spaceflight environment on the growth and the frequency of mutations to antibiotic resistance in the model organism Staphylococcus epidermidis strain ATCC12228 was investigated.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Planning is currently underway for future long-duration missions through interplanetary space to the Moon, near-Earth asteroids, or Mars (NASA, 2015). Both the National Research Council (NRC) and the International Space Exploration Coordination Group (ISECG) have assigned a high priority to studies aimed at better understanding astronaut health risks during space exploration;",
      "methods": "The strain used was S. epidermidis strain ATCC12228 obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA. Medium used throughout was trypticase soy yeast extract (TSY) medium consisting of (g/L): tryptone, 15; soytone, 5; NaCl, 5; yeast extract, 3; K2HPO4, 2.5; glucose, 2.5; and final pH 7.",
      "results": "Viable counts of the cultures in all six PDFUs were determined for both FL and GC samples (Figure 2A). All S. epidermidis cultures grew to high titers in both FL and GC experiments, and viable counts were significantly higher in the GC cultures (Figure 2A).",
      "discussion": "The observations that (i) astronaut immune function becomes dysregulated during long-term spaceflight (Gu√©guinou et al., 2009; Crucian et al., 2014; Taylor, 2015); (ii) certain opportunistic bacteria can upregulate virulence functions in spaceflight (Rosenzweig et al., 2014; Taylor, 2015); and (iii) spaceflight can alter the antibiotic resistance profiles of bacteria (Lapchine et al., 1986; Tixador et al., 1994) have underscored the importance of studying the causes and consequences of the development of bacterial antibiotic resistance in the human spaceflight environment."
