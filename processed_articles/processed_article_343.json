    "abstract": "Studies of how microorganisms respond to pressure have been limited mostly to the extreme high pressures of the deep sea (i.e., the piezosphere). In contrast, despite the fact that the growth of most bacteria is inhibited at pressures below ∼2.5 kPa, little is known of microbial responses to low pressure (LP). To study the global LP response, we performed transcription microarrays on Bacillus subtilis cells grown under normal atmospheric pressure (∼101 kPa) and a nearly inhibitory LP (5 kPa), equivalent to the pressure found at an altitude of ∼20 km.",

      "introduction": "On Earth, there are a number of harsh environments that challenge microbial life due to extremes of fundamental physical factors, such as temperature, pressure, pH, or osmolarity. It is thus of prime importance to understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms that enable microbes to grow and, indeed, to flourish at such physical extremes.",
      "methods": "All strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1. Strain WN624 (trpC2 amyE::spc) has been described in detail previously (32, 33). B. subtilis strain PB344, harboring a deletion-insertion mutation inactivating sigB, was obtained from Chet Price (34). B. subtilis strain BSM151, carrying a lacZ fusion to the SigB-dependent, general stress response (GSR)-induced ctc gene, was obtained from Uwe Völker (35).",
      "results": "In order to gain a greater understanding of the global gene expression changes occurring in response to LP, strain WN624 was studied using transcriptional microarrays. Total RNA was extracted from cells after 24 h of growth at either 5 kPa or ∼101 kPa, and RNA labeling and chip analyses were conducted as described in Materials and Methods.",
      "discussion": "Exposure of B. subtilis to LP most notably induced the SigB-mediated general stress response (GSR) (44); transition-state regulons such as AbrB/Abh (45, 46), CodY (47), Rok (48), SigH (49), Spo0A (50), and, to a lesser extent, SigD (51); anaerobic regulons, such as ResD (52) and, to a lesser extent, Fnr (53) and Rex (54); the carbon catabolite repression regulator"
