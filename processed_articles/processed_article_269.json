      "introduction": "Contractility of the heart is impaired with advancing age via mechanical remodeling, as myocytes are lost through apoptosis and collagenous fibers accumulate. Exercise training confers protection against fibrosis and apoptosis in the aging heart, but the mechanisms remain poorly understood.",
      "methods": "The Sod2 transgenic (Tg) mice overexpressing MnSOD used in this study were obtained from Dr. Epstein’s Laboratory (24).",
      "results": "To demonstrate that MnSOD protein levels remained elevated in the old Tg mice, we measured protein abundance of LV from young (8 months) and old (28 months) WT and Sod2 Tg mice.",
      "discussion": "The goal of this study was to investigate the role of MnSOD in protection of fibrosis, apoptosis, and remodeling of the aging heart, by overexpressing the Sod2 gene."
