However, while the natural environment of this model organism is 3D, quantitative investigations of its locomotion have been mostly limited to 2D motion.",

The rolls, during which the undulation plane of the worm rotates about the trajectory axis, constitute an important previously unrecognized behavioral pattern that is an essential component of 3D locomotion.
