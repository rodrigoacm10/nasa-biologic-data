    "abstract": "Impaired resorption of cartilage matrix deposited during endochondral ossification is a defining feature of juvenile osteopetrosis. Growing, leptin-deficient ob/ob mice exhibit a mild form of osteopetrosis. However, the extent to which the disease is (1) self-limiting and (2) reversible by leptin treatment is unknown.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "The appetite regulatory hormone leptin is produced by adipose tissue (Zhang, et al. 1994), circulates in levels proportional to total adiposity (Considine, et al. 1996), and may act to couple skeletal metabolism to energy availability (Gat-Yablonski, et al. 2004; Hamrick 2004; Iwaniec, et al. 2007; Steppan, et al. 2000; Turner, et al. 2013; Turner, et al. 2014).",
      "methods": "Male C57BL/6J (B6) mice and ob/ob mice on a B6 genetic background were obtained from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Maine). Mice were maintained in accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.",
      "results": "The effects of age and leptin status on cancellous bone area fraction in the femoral epiphysis and metaphysis and on cartilage retention in the femoral epiphysis, metaphysis, and diaphysis in WT and ob/ob mice are shown in Figure 1.",
      "discussion": "Compared to WT mice, more extracellular cartilage matrix was present in cancellous compartments (metaphysis and epiphysis) of distal femur in ob/ob mice. Cartilage matrix decreased with increasing age in both WT and ob/ob mice but, in marked contrast to WT mice, cartilage continued to be present in the epiphysis and metaphysis in skeletally mature 6-month-old ob/ob mice."
