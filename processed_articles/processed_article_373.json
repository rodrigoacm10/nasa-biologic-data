    "abstract": "The discovery of new drugs is often propelled by the increasing resistance of parasites to existing drugs and the availability of better technology platforms.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Parasitic nematodes have adopted a range of infection, survival, and propagation strategies within hosts of interest, including humans, domestic animals (e.g., cows, pigs, sheep, horses), and agricultural plants (e.g., soybean, corn, rice, potato).",
      "methods": "The microfluidic device is fabricated using soft lithography.",
      "results": "We found that a single parameter was unable to capture the overall drug effects through the experimental period.",
      "discussion": "Some modifications were made in our device design and methodology to simplify the earlier experimental method and optimize it for observing events leading to worm paralysis."
