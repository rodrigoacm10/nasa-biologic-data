    "abstract": "The present studies investigated the cellular mechanisms for the detrimental effects of high dose whole body γ-irradiation on bone. In addition, radioadaptation and bone marrow transplantation were assessed as interventions to mitigate the skeletal complications of irradiation.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Human exposure to high levels of ionizing radiation can occur as a result of treatment modalities or accident. Also, high dose whole body radiation is a common strategy in biomedical research to ablate bone marrow cells as a prelude to stem cell transplantation.",
      "methods": "Male and female C57BL/6 (B6) mice were used in the irradiation experiments (see Experiment 1-4 below) and female C57BL/6-Tg(CAG-EGFP)1Osb/J mice with constitutive expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) were used in the cell tracking experiment (see Experiment 5 below).",
      "results": "The efficacy of a radioconditioning priming dose of 0.5 mGy in preventing detrimental changes in bone mass and architecture in tibia and lumbar vertebra 14 days following exposure to a challenging dose of 6 Gy was evaluated by μCT, and results are presented in Table 1.",
      "discussion": "A 6 Gy whole-body dose of γ-radiation resulted in a rapid decline in bone marrow cell density. Despite the overall dramatic reduction in marrow cellularity, cellular indices of bone formation and resorption were increased."

Bone marrow transplantation is effective in mitigating the detrimental effects of acute exposure to high dose γ-radiation.",
