    "abstract": "Disuse-induced bone loss is seen following spinal cord injury, prolonged bed rest, and exposure to microgravity. We performed whole transcriptomic profiling of cortical bone using RNA sequencing (RNAseq) and RNA molecular barcoding (NanoString) on a hindlimb unloading (HLU) mouse model to identify genes whose mRNA transcript abundances change in response to disuse.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Mechanical loading plays an important role during musculoskeletal development and maintenance. Reduced mechanical loading from extended immobilization, spinal cord injury, or spaceflight leads to decreased bone mass and mineral density in humans, which increases susceptibility to skeletal fractures.",
      "methods": "Eleven-week old, female C57Bl/6J mice were randomly assigned to hindlimb unloading (HLU) or normal weightbearing (Cont) (n = 8/group). The HLU group underwent hindlimb unloading for 7 days according to the previously published studies [10â€“15].",
      "results": "Hindlimb unloading did not alter the quality of RNAseq data. For both groups, individual specimens yielded ~22 million reads with high unique mapping rates (79% for controls and 81% for HLU).",
      "discussion": "Our RNAseq dataset provides an unbiased approach for identifying genes whose transcripts change in response to mechanical unloading of cortical bone. We identified novel genes (e.g., Mss51, Pfkfb3) related to cell cycle, mitochondria, and cellular energy balance that were differentially regulated by HLU."
