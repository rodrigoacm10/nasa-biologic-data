    "abstract": "Space exploration and extraterrestrial civilization have fascinated humankind since the earliest days of human history. It was only in the last century that humankind finally began taking significant steps towards these goals by sending astronauts into space, landing on the moon, and building the International Space Station. However, space voyage is very challenging and dangerous, and astronauts are under constant space radiation and microgravity. It has been shown that astronauts are at a high risk of developing a broad range of diseases/disorders. Thus, it is critical to develop a rapid and effective assay to monitor astronauts’ health in space.",

      "introduction": "Space exploration and extraterrestrial civilization have continually fascinated humankind; however, it was only in the last century that humankind finally took a solid step forward by sending astronauts into space and landing on the moon [2,3]. In the 21st century, humankind has made another great leap forward in space exploration: expediting the International Space Station (ISS) program [4], sending unmanned rovers to seek signs of life on Mars [5,6], and starting private space ventures [7,8]. In addition, NASA (The National Aeronautics and Space Administration) is planning to send astronauts back to the moon in 2024 and to Mars in the 2030s [9]. Through all these endeavors, we have seen the twilight of crewed space missions going beyond our harbor (Earth) and into deep space.",
      "methods": "Microarray dataset E-GEOD-74708, which is the largest publicly available space gene expression dataset, was downloaded from the NASA GeneLab Database (https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab, accessed on 15 March 2021). It contains gene expression profiles for 10 astronauts (8 male and 2 female) that stayed in the ISS between July 2009 and February 2013.",
      "results": "We identified 218 differentially expressed genes between In-flight and Pre-flight and noticed that space travel decreased genome regulation and gene correlations across the entire genome, as well as individual signaling pathways.",
      "discussion": "Further studies, including microgravity experiments, are warranted to optimize and validate the proposed assay."
