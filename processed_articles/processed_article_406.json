      "introduction": "Spaceflight places multiple stresses upon the human body including altered gravity fields and exposure to cosmic radiation, which lead to health risks for spacefaring humans (Institute of Medicine, 2008). Decades of research on astronauts has begun to reveal how humans respond to the spaceflight environment (Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019) but physiological monitoring of astronauts is still limited. Thus, rodent models have been essential for advancing our understanding of how mammals—including humans—respond to spaceflight. This includes the impact of spaceflight on muscle structure (Shen et al., 2017; Spatz et al., 2017; Tascher et al., 2017), liver (Beheshti et al., 2019; Jonscher et al., 2016), and immune functions (Pecaut et al., 2017; Rettig et al., 2017; Ward et al., 2018).",
      "methods": "All methods can be found in the accompanying Transparent Methods supplemental file.",
      "results": "To assess gene expression differences in liver samples from the RR-1 NASA Validation mission (Cadena et al., 2019; Globus and Galazka, 2015; Ronca et al., 2019), RNA was extracted from livers dissected from spaceflight (FLT) and ground control (GC) animals either immediately after euthanasia (immediate preservation, I) or from frozen carcasses after partial thawing (carcass preservation, C) and sequenced following polyA selection (Figure S1).",
      "discussion": "Herein, we show that protocols used to preserve mouse carcasses on-orbit have large effects on gene expression patterns as measured by RNAseq. Indeed, changes in gene expression due to preservation condition overwhelmed those due to spaceflight."
