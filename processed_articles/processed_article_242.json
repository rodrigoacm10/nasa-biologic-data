    "abstract": "To explore how airborne microbial patterns change with height above the Earth’s surface, we flew NASA’s C-20A aircraft on two consecutive days in June 2018 along identical flight paths over the US Sierra Nevada mountain range at four different altitudes ranging from 10,000 ft to 40,000 ft.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Aerosols (mostly desert dust, black carbon and ocean spray) regularly disperse across the Pacific Ocean with springtime atmospheric winds – in fact, models suggest that as much as 64 Teragrams of Asian aerosols can be transported to North America annually1.",
      "methods": "Two research flights (Fig. 1) were flown over the Sierra Nevada mountains (Supplementary Fig. S1) across California using NASA’s C-20A Gulfstream III aircraft available through the Airborne Science Program at Armstrong Flight Research Center (AFRC).",
      "results": "Approximately 10 M reads were obtained for each flight sample. After LMAT analysis, which combines forward and reverse reads into a single unit, an average of 5 M reads per sample were uniquely assigned to a taxonomic identifier at the given score threshold14,15.",
      "discussion": "With an aerobiology study flown into the upper troposphere, we detected changing microbial abundance with height above the Earth’s surface – our dataset was reliant upon a shotgun metagenomics approach analyzing samples acquired between 10,000 to 40,000 ft,"
