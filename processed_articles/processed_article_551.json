    "abstract": "Monitoring the adaptation of microorganisms to the extreme environment of the International Space Station (ISS) is crucial to understanding microbial evolution and infection prevention. Acinetobacter pittii is an opportunistic nosocomial pathogen, primarily impacting immunocompromised patients, that was recently isolated from two missions aboard the ISS.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Any bacterial species introduced into space will inevitably face the extreme pressures inherent therein (e.g., microgravity and solar radiation). While humans also encounter these challenges during space flight and, indeed, our physiology is impacted by prolonged exposure—microbes possess the unique ability to adapt quickly due to rapid cell division (thereby mutation) and the acquisition of external DNA elements through horizontal gene transfer (HGT) [1].",
      "methods": "Using the NCBI’s entrez command line, we downloaded every genome annotated as A. pittii (NCBI taxonomic ID48296) from the NCBI’s assembly database.",
      "results": "We built a dataset comprising publicly available assembled genomes, metagenomic bins, and assembled, not-yet-public genomes that our team had sequenced from the ISS (Table 1).",
      "discussion": "Here, we report the progressive changes in the genetics and abundance of A. pittii aboard the ISS. We demonstrated that it forms a genetically and functionally distinct clade from strains associated with all other ecosystems."
