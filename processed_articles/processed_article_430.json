    "abstract": "In the near future, space agencies plan to send the first crews for extended stays on the Moon and Mars, where gravity is significantly reduced compared to Earth (0.16×g and 0.38×g, respectively). However, the long-term effects of partial gravity have not yet been elucidated, and ensuring astronauts’ health and performance is crucial to the success of these missions.",

      "introduction": "By providing a sustained mechanical load, gravity is crucial for the maintenance and health of the musculoskeletal system. Microgravity, accordingly, markedly alters musculoskeletal physiology.",
      "methods": "Wistar male rats, n = 149, (Charles River Laboratories Inc., Wilmington, MA, USA) weighing a mean ± standard error of 408 ± 0.15 g (14 weeks of age) were obtained and housed in a temperature-controlled (22 ± range of 2 °C) room with a 12:12-h light–dark cycle.",
      "results": "The consistency of the PWB level achieved was high (Fig. 1a). Indeed, all unloaded groups displayed minimal differences between their achieved and desired PWB level, which was further demonstrated by low coefficients of variation (PWB70: 0.54%, PWB40: 1.20%, PWB20: 0.95%).",
      "discussion": "In this study, we demonstrate that our PWB model in rats shows excellent reliability and is effective in modeling the impact of reduced mechanical loading on muscle health, with several muscle parameters presenting dose-dependent alterations."
