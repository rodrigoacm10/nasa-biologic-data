      "introduction": "Spaceflight experiments using mice are being conducted to determine the impact of microgravity on different muscle groups [1]. A major health problem in spaceflight is muscle wastage due to microgravity.",
      "methods": "Datasets from the GeneLab repository [15] related to skeletal muscle atrophy were mined for studying the effects of microgravity and low radiation doses in low Earth orbit found beyond Earthâ€™s atmosphere on mice.",
      "results": "The seven gene expression datasets have from three to eight expression values. The datasets were combined, and the significantly regulated genes were extracted using the Pearson correlation and Incremental Association Markov Blanket (IAMB) methods.",
      "discussion": "All of the 423 genes in the GDKG are highly activated and related to muscle atrophy in spaceflight."
