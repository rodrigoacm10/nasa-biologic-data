    "abstract": "Our previous research revealed a key microRNA signature that is associated with spaceflight that can be used as a biomarker and to develop countermeasure treatments to mitigate the damage caused by space radiation.",

      "introduction": "The perils of human space exploration span the gamut of exposure to space radiation, altered gravity fields, and prolonged isolation in a hostile/closed environment1. The profound effects on human health may include bone and muscle atrophy, increased intracranial pressure, enhanced risk of developing cancer and cardiovascular disease, and impaired neurocognitive functions2. These physical and psychological stressors present a major concern for maintaining the overall health of spaceflight crews.",
      "methods": "All mice experiments were approved by Brookhaven National Laboratory’s (BNL) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) (protocol number: 506) and were performed by trained personnel in AAALAC accredited animal facilities at BNL, while conforming to the U.S. National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.",
      "results": "We investigated the cellular alterations associated with the protective roles of three antagomirs targeting miR-16-5p, miR-125b-5p, and let-7a-5p in a 3D human microvasculature model.",
      "discussion": "Our previous study13–15 demonstrated a significant association between circulating miRNAs and spaceflight-associated health risks."
