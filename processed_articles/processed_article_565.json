    "abstract": "Alpha(α)Klotho, a soluble transmembrane protein, facilitates calcium-phosphorus homeostasis through feedback between bone and kidney and is a potential systemic biomarker for bone-kidney health during spaceflight. We determined if: (1) plasma αKlotho was reduced after both spaceflight aboard the ISS and hindlimb unloading (HU); and (2) deficiency could be reversed with exercise. Both spaceflight and HU lowered circulating plasma αKlotho: plasma αKlotho recovered with exercise after HU.",

      "introduction": "Atrophy of skeletal elements has long been identified as a hazard for the success of long-duration missions and astronaut quality of life1. US astronauts aboard the International Space Station (ISS) exhibit loss of bone density when comparing pre- and post-flight DXA scan measurements2,3. Bone density reduction for a Mars mission has been estimated of up to 36%4. Recovery from bone degradation appears to be incomplete5,6.",
      "methods": "The animal and environmental details of the ISS study (Rodent Research-9 mission), the accompanying HU study, and all approved IACUC protocols from Wake Forest School of Medicine, NASA Ames, and the Kenney Space Center have been published15. All mice were male, C57BL/6 (Jackson Labs) that were 10 weeks at the start of each study.",
