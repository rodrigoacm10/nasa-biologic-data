    "abstract": "Leptin-deficient ob/ob mice are morbidly obese and exhibit low total bone mass and mild osteopetrosis. In order to disassociate the skeletal effects of leptin deficiency from those associated with morbid obesity, we evaluated bone mass, architecture, gene expression, and indices of bone turnover in wild type (WT) mice, ob/ob mice fed ad libitum (ob/ob), and ob/ob mice pair fed to WT mice (pair-fed ob/ob).",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Leptin, a polypeptide hormone secreted by adipocytes, is best known for its role in the regulation of appetite and energy metabolism (Mistry, et al. 1997; Myers 2004). Rodents deficient in leptin signaling, due to either an inability to generate leptin (ob/ob mice) or the signaling form of the leptin receptor (db/db mice and fa/fa rats), become morbidly obese (Clement 2000).",
      "methods": "The experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee in accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Four-week-old female ob/ob (n=20) and homozygous WT (+/+) littermate (n=11) mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA).",
      "results": "The effects of pair feeding (to match food intake in WT mice) on body weight and cumulative food intake, and on abdominal WAT weight, blood glucose levels, uterine weight, and serum osteocalcin and CTx levels at sacrifice in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice housed at thermoneutral temperature are shown in Figure 1.",
      "discussion": "We investigated the contribution of excessive weight gain to the skeletal phenotype of leptin-deficient ob/ob mice. Mice were housed at 32°C and a group of ob/ob mice was pair-fed to WT mice."
