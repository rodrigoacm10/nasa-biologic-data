      "introduction": "Gravity is a natural force that drives all living organisms to acquire precise physiological mechanisms to survive.",
      "methods": "Oyster toadfish, Opsanus tau, of either sex, weighing âˆ¼400 g, were provided by the Resources Facilities of Marine Biological Laboratory (Woods Hole, MA, United States).",
      "results": "Response properties of utricular afferent were studied in control fish housed in 1 g to establish baseline measures needed for direct comparison within and across fish exposed to the different experimental conditions.",
      "discussion": "As a necessary first step in determining the role of the utricle in neural adaptation to novel gravity loads, otolith afferents were studied to establish benchmarks for comparison within and across the experimental groups."
