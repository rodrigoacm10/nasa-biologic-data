    "abstract": "Previous publications have shown that BRI1 EMS suppressor 1 (BES1), a positive regulator of the brassinosteroid (BR) signalling pathway, enhances cell divisions in the quiescent centre (QC) and stimulates columella stem cell differentiation. Here, it is demonstrated that BZR1, a BES1 homologue, also promotes cell divisions in the QC, but it suppresses columella stem cell differentiation, opposite to the action of BES1.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "The apical regions of plant roots are composed of mitotically inactive quiescent centre (QC) cells and the surrounding meristemic stem cell initials (epidermal-lateral root cap initials, cortical-endodermal initials, stele initials, and columella initials), which form a ‘stem cell niche’ (SCN) (Supplementary Figure S1 available at JXB online; Bennett and Scheres, 2010).",
      "methods": "Wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana (Columbia-0, Col-0), its ethylene biosynthesis mutant eto1-11 and BR-related mutants (det2, bri1-116, bzr1-D, and bri1-116/bzr1-D), and wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana (Enkheim-2, En-2) and its mutant bes1-D plants were used for QC, CSC, and columella cell (CC) phenotype analysis and root-regulating gene expression analysis.",
      "results": "The QC is the source of stem cell initials and is maintained at the G1/S cell cycle checkpoint and thus divides infrequently (Jiang and Feldman, 2005). BR-induced nuclear localization of BES1, a positive regulator of the BR signalling pathways, in the QC promotes QC reactivation, leading to production of two layers of QC cells (Gonzalez-Garcia et al., 2011; Heyman et al., 2013; Vilarrasa-Blasi et al., 2014) and results in CSC differentiation (Gonzalez-Garcia et al., 2011).",
      "discussion": "A root is formed from a reservoir of undifferentiated cells, called root stem cells, in the root apical meristem. QC cells act as integrators for many processes and events that are requisites for root meristem establishment and maintenance."
