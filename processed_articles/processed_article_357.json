    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Escherichia coli are versatile bacteria; with the majority being non-pathogenic and considered as commensals. A subset of these bacteria has acquired specific virulence attributes that confer an ability to survive in different niches and cause a broad spectrum of intestinal and extra-intestinal diseases [1], [2].",
      "methods": "Most of the bacterial strains used in this study, listed in Table 1, are derived from the highly virulent APEC strain χ7122 (O78∶K80∶H9) [79] and were fully described in our previous studies [10], [12], [80].",
      "results": "Genome sequencing has made major contributions to our knowledge of virulence and the evolution of pathogenic bacteria. So far, virulence plasmids associated with ExPEC are ColV, ColBM and Vir plasmids [20]; many of which are already fully sequenced and have been determined as belonging mainly to the IncFIB/FIIA backbone.",
      "discussion": "Our data reveal new insights into the role of extra-chromosomal sequences in fitness and diversity of ExPEC in their phenotypes."
