      "introduction": "The International Space Station (ISS) is an orbital space habitat which has been continuously inhabited by astronauts for 22 years (Robinson et al., 2006) and is therefore the only current model for how the microbiome of a space habitat evolves over time.",
      "methods": "Methods for preparing sampling kits and processing samples were similar to those used in the Microbial Tracking 1 mission (Singh et al., 2018; Checinska Sielaff et al., 2019).",
      "results": "Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1T isolated from the ISS was subjected to polyphasic taxonomic characterization to determine its phylogenetic affiliation.",
      "discussion": "We used multiple means of characterization, including phenotypic, chemotaxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional genome-prediction methods to characterize Cohnella sp. F6_2S_P_1T and place it within the established taxonomy of the genus Cohnella."
