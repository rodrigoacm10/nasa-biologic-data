    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Spacefaring nations carrying out interplanetary missions are subject to rules and regulations that were designed and instigated by the Committee on Space Research (COSPAR) in 1967 (COSPAR, 2011). Protocols for cleaning and sterilization are of the highest priority and are regularly practiced and meticulously followed during spacecraft assembly for various missions (Benardini et al., 2014).",
      "methods": "In this study, internal surfaces and external ground support equipment (GSE) of three CRV destined to the ISS were sampled (N = 22 and 3 controls; Table 1).",
      "results": "Microbial burden assays were aimed at using both cultivation-dependent and independent methods to assess the broad diversity of microorganisms on various locations sampled from CRV1 and CRV2 (see Table 1 for a description of each sample).",
      "discussion": "The current study aims at understanding the source of contamination of the ISS by characterizing the microbial diversity of the CRV just before launching."
