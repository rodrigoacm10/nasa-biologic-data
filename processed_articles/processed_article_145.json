      "introduction": "Plant roots have been long studied and yet investigations of root behavior, physiology, and biochemistry continue to be actively explored on every level [1–6].",
      "methods": "Arabidopsis thaliana plants (wild type cultivars Col-0 and WS) were grown on media plates made from 0.5x MS liquid media, autoclaved with 0.5% Phytagel and poured in square-gridded plates (Fisherbrand, Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA).",
      "results": "Arabidopsis ecotypes Wassilewskija (WS) and Columbia (Col-0) differ in their skewing and waving behaviors, where WS demonstrates strong skewing and waving while Col-0 waves like WS but does not greatly skew, which was a growth pattern observed in spaceflight and on the ground (selected references: [14, 17, 49]).",
      "discussion": "The primary set of 92 candidate genes involved in skewing was identified by comparing the transcription of WS genes when grown at Agp 45° or 135° compared to Agp 90°."
