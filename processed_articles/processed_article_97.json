    "abstract": "Sequencing antibody repertoires has steadily become cheaper and easier. Sequencing methods usually rely on some form of amplification, often a massively multiplexed PCR prior to sequencing. To eliminate potential biases and create a data set that could be used for other studies, our lab compared unamplified sequencing results from the splenic heavy-chain repertoire in the mouse to those processed through two commercial applications.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Antibodies are B cell proteins that play a vital role in adaptive immunity. These complex molecules, and their diverse specificities are defined at several levels.",
      "methods": "RNA was prepared as outlined in Rettig et al 2017 (9). Briefly, RNA was extracted from the spleens of four nine-week old female C57Bl/6J mice.",
      "results": "Most studies examining immunoglobulin repertoires use amplification to increase the depth of sequencing, but amplification comes with some drawbacks.",
      "discussion": "Illumina sequencing of total RNA from mouse spleen is able to capture a representative sample of the splenic B cell repertoire."
