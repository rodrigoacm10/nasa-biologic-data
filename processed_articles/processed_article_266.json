    "abstract": "Understanding the response of plants to varied gravitational conditions is vital for developing effective food production in space bioregenerative life support systems. This study examines the impact of altered gravity conditions on the growth and morphological responses of Wolffia globosa (commonly known as “water lentils” or “duckweed”), assessing its potential as a space crop.",

      "introduction": "Wolffia globosa, commonly known as “water lentils” is a member of the Wolffoideae subfamily within the Lemnaceae family, shares similar biological traits with its Lemnoideae relatives: it is the smallest flowering plant and shows the fastest growth rate in the plant kingdom and lacks a pseudo root system1,2.",
      "methods": "Plants of Wolffia globosa (9910) have been provided by Prof. Klaus Apperoth from the Department of Plant Physiology of the University of Jena, Germany.",
      "results": "The analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed a significant difference (F = 16.47, p < 0.001) for the RGR among the different gravity treatments.",
      "discussion": "The findings of this study shed light on the response of Wolffia globosa to altered gravitational conditions."
