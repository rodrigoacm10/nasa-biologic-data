    "abstract": "Healthy plants are vital for successful, long-duration missions in space, as they provide the crew with life support, food production, and psychological benefits. The microorganisms that associate with plant tissues play a critical role in improving plant health and production.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "As humanity strives to prepare for the upcoming manned missions to the Moon and cis-lunar orbit, it has become evident that growing plants for food and other life support systems is essential to humankind’s space exploration agenda1–4.",
      "methods": "Seeds of red romaine lettuce, L. sativa cv “Outredgeous” were surface-sanitized with a bleach-hydrochloric acid solution (30 ml 6% Pure Bright Germicidal Ultra Bleach and 500 μl 37% hydrochloric acid) for 1 h and allowed to off-gas for 24 h prior to planting.",
      "results": "To ensure a comprehensive assessment of the microbes on the edible portion of the lettuce crop, both endophytic and epiphytic microbes of lettuce leaves were collected from plants grown in environmental chambers at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) that mimicked conditions used aboard the ISS.",
      "discussion": "To prepare for a long-duration spaceflight, it will be critical to develop effective and rapid monitoring tools to evaluate changes in the microbiomes associated with both the spacecraft and the organisms within."
