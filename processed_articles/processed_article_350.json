    "abstract": "RNA polymerase (RNAP) is a highly conserved macromolecular machine that contributes to the flow of genetic information from genotype to phenotype. In Bacillus subtilis, mutations in the rpoB gene encoding the Î²-subunit of RNAP have been shown to alter a number of global phenotypes, including growth, utilization of unusual nutrient sources, sporulation, germination, and production of secondary metabolites.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Transcription in bacteria depends on a complex of proteins collectively known as RNA polymerase (RNAP), and bacterial responses to their environment are in large part due to alterations in their global pattern of transcription, i.e., the transcriptome.",
      "methods": "All B. subtilis strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1. The strains were constructed by DNA-mediated transformation of competent cells with purified genomic DNA as previously described.",
      "results": "The natural environment often contains inhibitory or subinhibitory levels of various antibiotics; thus, natural antibiotic resistance would confer a selective advantage in such environments.",
      "discussion": "In the absence of Rif selection, it has been noted previously that mutations in rpoB leading to Rifr often exert a fitness cost, such as a lower growth rate as measured in standard laboratory media."
