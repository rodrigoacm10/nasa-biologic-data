    "abstract": "Space flight has many adverse effects on the physiological functions of astronauts. Certain similarities have been observed in some physiological processes of rodents and astronauts in space, although there are also differences. These similarities make rodents helpful models for initial investigations into space-induced physiological changes.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "The space environment is extremely complex, characterized by strong radiation, high vacuum, extreme temperatures, and microgravity, as well as other environmental factors [1,2]. These factors are collectively referred to as space composite stress, which can directly or indirectly threaten the health and safety of astronauts [3,4]. Microgravity, in particular, is a significant factor affecting the health of astronauts aboard a spacecraft and has therefore received considerable attention from researchers [5].",
      "methods": "C57BL/6 male mice (specific pathogen free, SPF grade, 6 weeks, weighing (20 Â± 2)g) and sterilized mouse growth maintenance feed were obtained from Changsheng Biotech (Benxi, China).",
      "results": "We established a microgravity animal model for C57BL/6 mice using a 3D-Clinostat (Figure 1a), with Video S1 showing the operation of the clinostat and Figure S1a demonstrating the design drawing of the mouse survival box.",
      "discussion": "The complex environment of space, including strong radiation, high vacuum, extreme temperatures and microgravity, can directly or indirectly threaten the health and safety of astronauts [46,47]."
