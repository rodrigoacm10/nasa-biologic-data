    "abstract": "Like many other organisms, plants are capable of sensing and responding to mechanical stimuli such as touch, osmotic pressure, and gravity. One mechanism for the perception of force is the activation of mechanosensitive (or stretch-activated) ion channels, and a number of mechanosensitive channel activities have been described in plant membranes.",

This channel had a conductance of âˆ¼100 pS, consistent with the hypothesis that it underlies an activity previously observed in the plasma membrane of plant root cells.",
