    "abstract": "The undesirable, yet inevitable, presence of bacterial biofilms in spacecraft poses a risk to the proper functioning of systems and to astronauts’ health. To mitigate the risks that arise from them, it is important to understand biofilms’ behavior in microgravity.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "In previous and current spaces stations (Salyut-6 and -7, Mir, and the International Space Station (ISS)), damage caused by bacterial biofilms on hardware have resulted in function disruption and failures of myriad equipment (summarized in Zea et al., 2018, 20201,2).",
      "methods": "The reagents and hardware were prepared as described in Flores et al. (2022)18. In brief, the PBS was prepared with PBS pellets (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. P4417) and autoclaved.",
      "results": "The biomass, thickness, and surface area coverage of biofilms formed on SS316 were not statistically different from those of biofilms grown on pSS316 (α = 0.05) at any incubation day (Supplementary Figure 1 and raw data in Supplementary Table 1).",
      "discussion": "In this experiment, biofilm shape and general structure appearance was not affected by gravitational regime. Contrary to what has been previously reported for anaerobic P. aeruginosa PA14 biofilm growth in space31, we observed less robust biofilms in terms of biomass, thickness, and surface area coverage in microgravity with respect to 1 g."
