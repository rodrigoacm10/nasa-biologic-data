    "abstract": "The commercialization of space travel will soon lead to many more people living and working in unique built environments similar to the International Space Station, which is a specialized closed environment that contains its own indoor microbiome.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "In the next decade, more people than ever will be working and living in space. This will be fueled in part by the National Aeronautics and Space Agency (NASA) Commercial Low-Earth Orbit Destination initiative that will support private companies such as Starlab Space, LLC, and Blue Origin to build and operate the next generation of space stations [1].",
      "methods": "Dust samples were obtained from four vacuum bags that came from weekly housekeeping activities to clean the protective screen covers for the HEPA filters which are part of the ISS air ventilation system.",
      "results": "Dust was received from four vacuum bags from the ISS with an average initial fungal concentration of 4.39 × 106 spore equivalents (SE)/mg dust and an average bacterial load of 1.06 × 107 cells/mg dust.",
      "discussion": "To date, all microbial studies that have been performed related to spaceflight samples have focused on characterizing what is there including water, surface, dust, and air samples [55–57], but not what happens when moisture becomes elevated and unintended growth occurs."
