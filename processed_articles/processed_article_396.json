    "abstract": "The Space Shuttle Atlantis launched on its final mission (STS-135) on July 8, 2011. After just under 13 days, the shuttle landed safely at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) for the last time. Female C57BL/6J mice flew as part of the Commercial Biomedical Testing Module-3 (CBTM-3) payload. Ground controls were maintained at the KSC facility. Subsets of these mice were made available to investigators as part of NASA’s Bio-specimen Sharing Program (BSP). Our group characterized cell phenotype distributions and phagocytic function in the spleen, catecholamine and corticosterone levels in the adrenal glands, and transcriptomics/metabolomics in the liver. Despite decreases in most splenic leukocyte subsets, there were increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS)-related activity.",

      "introduction": "The final US Space Shuttle mission, STS-135, launched on July 8, 2011. After 12 days, 18 hours and 29 minutes, Space Shuttle Atlantis landed safely at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) for the last time. One of the many experiments flown on this historic flight to the International Space Station (ISS) was BioServe Space Technology’s Commercial Biomedical Testing Module-3 (CBTM-3). Sponsored by Amgen, Inc., the last animal flight of the shuttle era was intended to test the impact of their proprietary pharmaceutical agent on spaceflight-induced musculoskeletal atrophy.",
      "methods": "On July 8, 2011, age- and weight-matched, 11 week old, female C57BL/6J mice (n = 15/group) were placed into three Animal Enclosure Modules (AEMs, 2 groups of 5 per AEM separated by a wire mesh) and flown on the Space Shuttle Atlantis (STS-135) for ~13 days.",
      "results": "There were no significant differences in total body mass at the time of sacrifice (AEM 19.5 ± 0.5 g, Flight 18.4 ± 0.5 g). Sample size: n = 8 for AEM ground controls, n = 7 for Flight. However, when calculated as a difference from preflight, baseline mass, we previously reported that spaceflight mice lost significantly more mass compared to AEM controls [35].",
      "discussion": "Spaceflight appears to have had a significant impact on both immune and metabolomic function. These differences occur in the cell count and proportion data (see S1 Discussion), cell function, metabolites and in gene expression."
