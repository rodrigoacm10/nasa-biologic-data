      "introduction": "Perhaps, the most common type of animal symbiosis, whether pathogenic, commensal or mutualistic, is the interaction of microbial cells along the apical surfaces of polarized host epithelia (for reviews, see Fraune and Bosch, 2010; Hooper, 2015).",
      "methods": "Adult E. scolopes were collected and maintained as previously described (Wollenberg and Ruby, 2012).",
      "results": "Previous studies showed that the phenomenon of daily venting of symbionts by adult E. scolopes depends on an exogenous ‘dawn’ light cue, i.e., onset of light in animals entrained to a 12:12 light/dark (L/D) cycle (Graf and Ruby, 1998; Nyholm and McFall-Ngai, 1998).",
      "discussion": "The results of this study on the squid-vibrio symbiosis, which exploited the capability to manipulate juvenile animals experimentally, provide evidence that (i) effacement of the brush border occurs daily around dawn in juveniles and persists throughout the life time of the host;"
