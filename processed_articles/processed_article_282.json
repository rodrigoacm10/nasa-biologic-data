      "introduction": "Gravity plays a key role in plant growth [1]. Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) is a flowering plant that has been chosen by biologists as a model plant organism to study the effects of gravity and other environmental stressors, since it has a short life cycle and because of the existence of a multitude of mutants and transgenic plants.",
