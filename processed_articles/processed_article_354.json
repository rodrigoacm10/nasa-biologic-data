    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Bacterial growth environments characterized by low fluid shear force have been shown to induce a multitude of phenotypic responses, including altered acid, oxidative, thermal, and osmotic stress resistance (7, 33, 36, 41, 52–55), increased biofilm formation (6, 33, 52), altered protein secretion (14, 15), altered cell surface lipid and polysaccharide profiles (6, 7, 55), and increased survival in cellular and animal hosts (39, 52–54).",
      "methods": "Please refer to Table 1 for a list of strains and plasmids used in this study.",
      "results": "We used the S. Typhimurium YdcI protein sequence (GenBank accession no. AAL20543) as a query in a BLAST search for homologs in the protein database.",
      "discussion": "Growth conditions such as spaceflight and RWV culture that are characterized by low fluid shear force have been shown to increase bacterial virulence (39, 52, 53)."
