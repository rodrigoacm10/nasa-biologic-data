    "abstract": "Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is associated with an increased risk of vertebral compression fracture (1–5). While bone is typically considered radiation-resistant, fractures frequently occur within the first year of SBRT (6–11).",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Radiation therapy (RT) is a risk factor for bone morbidity and fracture (12–15). Vertebral RT significantly increases the risk of post-treatment vertebral compression fracture (VCF) (1–5).",
      "methods": "Sixteen male rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) were exposed to uniform total chest irradiation using anterior-posterior parallel-opposed 6 MV x-ray beams.",
      "results": "Eight NHPs were removed from the study between the 2 and 4 month time points due to pulmonary complications;",
      "discussion": "As the use of high dose per fraction SBRT becomes more commonplace in modern practice, it is important to understand and quantify the impact of high dose RT on surrounding normal bone both inside and outside the treatment field."
