      "introduction": "The International Space Exploration Coordination Group, which now comprises 20 national space agencies, recently published the third edition of the Global Exploration Roadmap [1] outlining a strategy to expand human presence in the solar system and setting the surface of Mars as a collaborative target for 2030.",
      "methods": "The Mars500 experiment was a ground-based human isolation study conducted over 520 days which aimed to simulate a manned mission to Mars [17], [20], [25].",
      "results": "A total of 408 exact sequence variants (ESVs) were assembled and captured 71.78% of the total 4,837,317 amplicons sequenced, including 213 ESVs present in all six astronauts in the early (7–45 days) and late (420–520 days) samples alone.",
      "discussion": "Recent metagenomic studies indicate that the majority of gastrointestinal track (GIT) microbiome members are still unknown or uncharacterised species [53]."

    "insights_summary": "Significant changes in the relative abundance of astronaut microbiome species occurred over the 520 days of isolation. Some enrichment of known bacteria corresponded to changes in the crew’s diet, although significant enrichment of unknown species highlights the ongoing challenge faced in understanding how complex microbiome interactions influence human health.",
