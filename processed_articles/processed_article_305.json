    "abstract": "Microgravity is associated with immunological dysfunction, though the mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, using single-cell analysis of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) exposed to short term (25 hours) simulated microgravity, we characterize altered genes and pathways at basal and stimulated states with a Toll-like Receptor-7/8 agonist.",

      "introduction": "Astronauts in low earth orbit (LEO), such as on the international space station (ISS), experience immune dysfunction associated with the microgravity environment.",
      "methods": "Studies were conducted under the supervision and in accordance with ethical guidelines of the Buck Institute for Research on Aging.",
      "results": "To begin understanding how simulated microgravity impacts immune cell function, we loaded PBMC samples from two young healthy CMV+ donors, one male, and one female, into either RWV simulated microgravity (uG) or normal gravity (1G) static controls for 16 hours of conditioning.",
      "discussion": "Immune dysfunction during spaceflight is an important health risk, and manifests primarily as increased vulnerability to opportunistic infections, including latent viral reactivation"
