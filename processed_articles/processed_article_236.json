    "abstract": "N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) supplementation has been associated with reduced mortality and inflammation in patients with cardiovascular disease. There are limited data on the effects of n-3 PUFA supplementation in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD).",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "The effects of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) supplementation on systemic inflammation1,2 and cardiovascular disease (CVD)3 have been described in many populations. In addition, studies have shown that n-3 PUFA supplementation is associated with improvements in endothelial function,4,5 reduction in platelet aggregation,6 and improved atherosclerotic plaque stability.7 Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are the main PUFAs in fish oil and are substrates for enzymes that give rise to specialized proresolving lipid mediators (SPMs), specifically D-series resolvins, E-series resolvins, maresins, and protectins.8 These SPMs have receptor-mediated actions on human leukocytes, platelets, and vascular cells and have been shown to actively promote resolution of vascular inflammation and decrease atherosclerosis and vascular injury in animal models.8–10",
      "methods": "The OMEGA-PAD II trial is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial. The study protocol was based on the previously published OMEGA-PAD I trial13,14 and took place at the San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center (SFVAMC) between 2014 and 2016. Patients aged ≥50 y presenting to the outpatient vascular surgery clinic at the SFVAMC with intermittent claudication (Rutherford I-III) and PAD were recruited to the study.",
      "results": "Twenty-four patients were enrolled in the study (all male), with 11 randomized to the fish oil group and 13 randomized to the placebo group (Supplemental Fig. 2). Recruitment for the trial was slower than expected and was ended by the principal investigator before reaching target enrollment.",
      "discussion": "The OMEGA-PAD II trial was designed to investigate the effects of 3 mo of high-dose n-3 PUFA supplementation on inflammation and vascular function in patients with PAD. No difference in hsCRP was observed between the fish oil and placebo group, and no significant differences in functional outcomes were observed."
