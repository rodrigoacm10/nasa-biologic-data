The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that mesenteric arteries and veins will exhibit diminished vasoconstrictor responses after spaceflight.",

Vasoconstriction evoked through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release was also diminished in arteries from SF mice. The blunted constriction to caffeine was associated with lower arterial RyR-2 and RyR-3 mRNA, indicating that the...",
