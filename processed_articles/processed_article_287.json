    "abstract": "Spaceflight poses many challenges for humans. Ground-based analogs typically focus on single parameters of spaceflight and their associated acute effects. This study assesses the long-term transcriptional effects following single and combination spaceflight analog conditions using the mouse model: simulated microgravity via hindlimb unloading (HLU) and/or low-dose γ-ray irradiation (LDR) for 21 days, followed by 4 months of readaptation.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "The central nervous system (CNS) is vulnerable to irradiation [1] and fluid shifts [2] experienced during short- and long-term spaceflight.",
      "methods": "Six-month-old, female C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Laboratory), as previously reported [10], were utilized in this report.",
      "results": "To assess the effects of prolonged spaceflight-like conditions on central nervous system (CNS) health following exposure, 6-month-old female C57BL/6J mice were either irradiated with low-dose γ-ray irradiation (0.04 Gy, LDR), hindlimb unloaded (HLU) or a combination of the two (HLU+LDR) for 21 days, followed by a 4-month readaptation period.",
      "discussion": "Herein, we identified that chronic exposure (21 days) to single or combined HLU and LDR resulted in long-term transcriptional alterations in CNS brain tissue in female mice at 4 months post-exposure."
