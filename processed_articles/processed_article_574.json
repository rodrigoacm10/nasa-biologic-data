    "abstract": "While sequencing technologies have revolutionized our knowledge of microbial diversity, little is known about the dynamic emergent phenotypes that arise within the context of mixed-species populations, which are not fully predicted using sequencing technologies alone.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Technological advances in recent years have enabled unprecedented insight into potable water microbiota using culture-independent methods (e.g., next-generation sequencing), revealing the vastly underestimated diversity in these communities.",
      "methods": "Strains were obtained from NASA and isolates were identified by 16 S rRNA gene sequencing and/or a biochemical identification using a VITEK system (BioMerieux) by the NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC).",
      "results": "Our analysis showed Burkholderiales, which includes the genera Burkholderia (mostly Burkholderia cepacia complex, Bcc), Ralstonia, and Cupriavidus, to be the predominant order comprising 63.25% of the total ISS water isolates, and Ralstonia pickettii to be the major species of the order.",
      "discussion": "Microbial interactions within natural and artificial environments are typically investigated over a short period of time (hours to days)."
