    "abstract": "Metabolic and immune mediators activate many of the same signal transduction pathways. Therefore, molecules that regulate metabolism often affect immune responses. Leptin is an adipokine that exemplifies this interplay. Leptin is the body’s major nutritional status sensor, but it also plays a key role in immune system regulation. To provide an in vitro tool to investigate the link between leptin and innate immunity, we immortalized and characterized a leptin receptor-deficient macrophage cell line, DB-1. The cell line was created using bone marrow cells from leptin receptor-deficient mice. Bone marrow cells were differentiated into macrophages by culturing them with recombinant mouse macrophage colony stimulating factor, and passaged when confluent for 6 months. The cells spontaneously immortalized at approximately passage 20. Cells were cloned twice by limiting dilution cloning prior to characterization. The macrophage cell line is diploid and grows at a linear rate for 4–5 days before reaching the growth plateau. The cells are MAC-2 and F4/80 positive and have phagocytic activity similar to primary macrophages from wild-type and leptin receptor-deficient mice. DB-1 cells were responsive to stimulation with interferon-γ as measured by increase in Nos2 transcript levels. In addition, DB-1 macrophages are not responsive to the chemotactic signaling of adipocyte conditioned media nor leptin when compared to primary WT macrophages. We believe that DB-1 cells provide a dependable tool to study the role of leptin or the leptin receptor in obesity-associated inflammation and immune system dysregulation.",

      "introduction": "Leptin, the product of the ob gene, is a 16 kDa peptide hormone predominantly secreted by white adipocytes (Ahima and Flier 2000; Zhang et al. 1994). Leptin is structurally similar to type I cytokines and referred to as an adipokine or adipocytokine (Otero et al. 2005). Leptin signals through its receptor (LepR) encoded by the Lepr gene (Chen et al. 1996). The LepR exists in six alternatively spliced isoforms (Lee et al. 1996). The long isoform of LepR is a member of the interleukin-6 receptor family of class 1 cytokine receptors, and is responsible for most of leptin’s physiological activities (Baumann et al. 1996; Tartaglia et al. 1995).",
      "methods": "Male leptin receptor-deficient (db/db) mice as well as gender- and aged-matched wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 mice controls were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). All animal procedures were performed with prior approval and regular monitoring of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Kansas State University.",
      "results": "We established an immortal leptin receptor-deficient cell line from mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages. Bone marrow cells from leptin receptor deficient mice (db/db) were collected and cultured in biomedium as described in the Materials and Methods section. Differentiated macrophages were passaged at confluency. Cells were kept in biomedium for 6 months when the cells appeared to grow at a stable rate after twenty passages. At that time, we did two consecutive limiting dilution cloning procedures. The DB-1 cells were selected from cloned cells from the second cloning. DB-1 cells lost their dependency to M-CSF during the cloning process. They were propagated and shifted to a regular medium, DMEM supplemented with 2 % Nu serum and 2 % FBS. DB-1 cells exhibit morphological properties characteristic of macrophages, and are adherent with multiple processes (Fig. 1).",
      "discussion": "We created a leptin-receptor deficient cell line, DB-1, that has some phenotypic and functional properties characteristic of primary macrophages. It is diploid, has the normal complement of chromosomes, lacks the long isoform of the leptin receptor, and is unresponsive to leptin."
