      "introduction": "Life on Earth evolved in the presence of a nearly uniform gravitational field (Turner, 2000). Not surprisingly, the near absence of ‘weight’ during orbital spaceflight results in profound adaptive responses in multiple organ systems, including the skeleton.",

      "discussion": "Rodents—historically rats and more recently mice—are the primary animal model for investigating the effects and underlying mechanisms of action of spaceflight on the skeleton."
