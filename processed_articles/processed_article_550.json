    "abstract": "The use of film media involves considerably less preparation, waste, and incubator space than conventional agar-media-based assays and has proven in past studies to provide counts of cultivable microbes similar to those of traditional agar media.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Counts of cultivable bacteria and fungi from food items, water samples, and surfaces are a traditional mainstay for public health standards and assessment, as well as the core method that NASA uses to ensure that any craft or robot launched into space meets planetary protection regulations.",
      "methods": "According to the manufacturerâ€™s instruction manuals, Petrifilm Aerobic Count (AC) Plate [15] (3M, Saint Paul, MN, USA, Cat# 6400) and Easy Plate AC [16] (Kikkoman, Noda, Chiba, Japan, Cat# 61973) were used for the enumeration of aerobic bacteria, and Petrifilm Rapid Yeast and Mold Count (RYM) Plate (3M, Cat# 6475) and Easy Plate YM-R (Kikkoman, Cat# 61977) were used for the enumeration of yeast and mold in the food and beverage industries.",
      "results": "The microbial population enumerated with traditional agar plate, Petrifilm, and Easy Plate are depicted in Figure 1. All three types of media were used for the comparison of food products (Figure 1A) and built environments (Figure 1B for bacteria and Figure 1C for fungi).",
      "discussion": "In general, the use of film media over agar allows for lower costs, greatly increased inoculation speed, greatly reduced experimental preparation time, and much smaller amounts of space required in incubators or counters; these advantages have been discussed in numerous previous reports."
