    "insights_summary": "This study presents the draft genome sequences of three species belonging to the family Bacillaceae, isolated from the International Space Station. The sequences were collected using premoistened polyester wipes and were identified by 16S rRNA sequencing. The study aims to understand the roles of these bacteria for space and biotechnological applications.",
