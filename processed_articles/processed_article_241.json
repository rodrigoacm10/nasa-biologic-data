Assessing the interplay between the microbial community of the ISS and its crew is important for preventing biomedical and structural complications for long term human spaceflight missions.",

      "introduction": "An increased focus on the relationship between indoor buildings and human health has led to a recognition that the International Space Station (ISS) is particularly well suited for studying microbiome within structures because the orbiting outpost is a uniquely isolated “island” in space [1].",
      "methods": "Crewmember sample collection was a study approved by the Johnson Space Center Institutional Review Board (IRB) under IRB protocol Pro1974.",
      "results": "Overall, sequencing reads from crewmember samples were mapped to 1,394 genera and 5,192 species.",
      "discussion": "Learning the rules governing microbial communities is important for the advancement of spaceflight activities."
