      "introduction": "Three-dimensional (3D) cell culture is critical for understanding the function of cells in a physiologically relevant context and for tissue engineering complex solid organs like the liver [1].",

      "results": "Hepatocyte 3D aggregates generated in rotating wall vessels (RWVs) demonstrated improved hepatocyte-specific functions compared to monolayers in tissue culture dishes (TCDs).",
      "discussion": "In this study, we used global gene expression profiling and promoter region analyses to identify molecular differences between primary mouse hepatocytes cultured as monolayers on TCDs and as 3D aggregates generated in RWVs."
