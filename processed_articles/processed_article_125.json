    "abstract": "Bone health and cardiovascular function are compromised in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The purpose of the present study was to determine whether skeletal vascular control mechanisms are altered during the progression of T2DM in the Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rat.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "The increase in fracture risk observed among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has been suggested to be associated with corollaries of the disease, such as peripheral neuropathy, decreased physical fitness, vision loss, and poor balance (Leslie, et al. 2012, Melton, et al. 2008, Schwartz. 2003). Emerging research also suggests a causal link between cardiovascular function and indices of bone health (Farhat & Cauley. 2008, Lampropoulos, et al. 2012, Parfitt. 2000, Prisby, et al. 2012).",
      "methods": "All experimental procedures were approved by the University of Floridaâ€™s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and conformed to the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Eighth edition, 2011).",
      "results": "Body mass was greater in obese ZDF rats in the pre-diabetic, short-term and long-term diabetic conditions relative to the age-matched lean controls (Table 1).",
      "discussion": "The results show few adverse effects of the pre-diabetic and short-term diabetic conditions on the vasodilator or vasoconstrictor properties of the femoral PNA. However, with long-term diabetes the PNA shifts toward a more pro-vasoconstrictor phenotype."
