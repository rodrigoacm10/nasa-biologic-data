    "abstract": "In all species studied, afferents from semicircular canals and otolith organs converge on central neurons in the brainstem. However, the spatial and temporal relationships between converging inputs and how these contribute to vestibular behaviors is not well understood.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "The vestibular system consists of biological sensors that detect head movements in space. The semicircular canals and otolith organs detect angular and linear head accelerations, respectively. In the brainstem, canal and otolith afferents terminate on neurons in the vestibular nuclear complex (VNC).",
      "methods": "Twelve adult pigeons (Columba livia, 400–700g, Double T Farm, Glenwood IA) were used in accordance with the guidelines set forth by the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Animals in Research, as well as those approved by the Institutional Animal Studies Committee.",
      "results": "Responses were obtained from 56 convergent neurons in the vestibular nuclear complex (VNC), each of which was sensitive to both rotational and linear translational motion.",
      "discussion": "We characterized the canal- and otolith-related contributions to convergent NEM neuron responses using motion that dynamically stimulated one set of receptor inputs at a time."

    "insights_summary": "We characterized the spatial and temporal characteristics of vestibular convergence in the brainstem. Our results show that convergent inputs were spatially aligned when co-stimulated during tilt, but temporally out of phase during tilt co-stimulation. Net responses to tilt were not predicted by a linear combination of convergent inputs.",
