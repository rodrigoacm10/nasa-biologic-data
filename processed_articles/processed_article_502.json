    "abstract": "While numerous health-beneficial interactions between host and microbiota have been identified, there is still a lack of targeted approaches for modulating these interactions.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "While traditionally considered commensals, it is becoming increasingly clear that the microbial communities living within and on higher host organisms (i.e., the microbiome) are integral parts of host physiology.",
      "methods": "We explored to what extent individual metabolites, which are only taken up by a single bacterial species and no other, could serve as potential supplements to target individual species.",
      "results": "The simplest approach to specifically boost the abundance of a particular bacterial species in a microbial community is to supply the community with a compound that is only taken up by the target species but no other species.",
      "discussion": "Although many factors are known to influence microbiome composition [e.g., dietary patterns, lifestyle, or medication (61)], the mechanisms causing these changes are often not fully understood and often a large number of bacterial species are affected."
