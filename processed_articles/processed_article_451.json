    "abstract": "Renewable fuels hold great promise for the future yet their susceptibility to biodegradation and subsequent corrosion represents a challenge that needs to be directly assessed. Biodiesel is a renewable fuel that is widely used as a substitute or extender for petroleum diesel and is composed of a mixture of fatty acid methyl esters derived from plant or animal fats.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "The use of renewable fuels is on the rise worldwide (Beiter and Tian, 2016). One renewable fuel in use broadly is biodiesel, which is composed of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) derived from plant and animal lipids.",
      "methods": "The yearlong longitudinal study described here was conducted at two USAF bases, which were located in the SE and SW United States.",
      "results": "Surface samples taken at each time point in each UST from coated coupons, uncoated coupons, and O-rings (representing biofilm communities), and filter quarters (representing fuel communities) were sequenced after sampling.",
      "discussion": "The advantages of blending or replacing ULSD with biodiesel include increased fuel performance and significant reductions in carbon emissions (Gill et al., 2012)."
