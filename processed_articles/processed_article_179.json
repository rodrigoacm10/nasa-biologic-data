    "abstract": "Animals rely on nervous systems to cope with environmental variability, whereas plants are characterized by lack of nervous system but still have evolved systemic communication systems through signaling molecules that trigger long-distance defense signaling events when encountered with environmental challenges.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Animals rely on well-developed nervous systems to dexterously take prompt movements and rapidly facilitate long-range information exchange in front of the changing environment. In mammalian nervous systems, many different types of chemical substances, including amino acids (e.g., glutamate), monoamines (e.g., dopamine, norepinephrine), acetylcholine, peptides (e.g., substance P), serve as neurotransmitters to bind their corresponding receptors, then activate ion channels, and consequently produce ion flux1, thereby inducing membrane potential changes that lead to signal propagation for neurotransmission1–4.",
      "methods": "hairpin RNA-52 (hr-52) was obtained from the rolling circle amplification-mediated hairpin RNA (RMHR)-based Arabidopsis library in our previous study19,20. pad2-1 was ordered from the Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre (NASC). Seeds of GCaMP3 were from Simon Gilroy (Department of Botany, University of Wisconsin). The GCaMP3/pad2-1 was generated by genetic crosses using standard procedures.",
      "results": "During the genetic screening of the rolling circle amplification-mediated hairpin RNA (RMHR)-based Arabidopsis library19,20 for mutants with altered defense response to a disastrous plant fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea (B. cinerea), we identified a mutant, termed hairpin RNA-52 (hr-52), which exhibited obvious susceptibility to B. cinerea infection (Supplementary Fig. 1).",
      "discussion": "Initiation of a rapid defense against biotic attacks and mechanical damages is crucial for plant survival in changing environment."
