      "introduction": "To determine the health risks associated with long-term space travel, it is essential to consider the effects of space microgravity (SPC-µG) on the brain.",
      "methods": "Induced pluripotent human neural stem cells known as cell line “CS83iCTR-33n21” derived from skin fibroblasts were used for the space flight.",
      "results": "Observations of SPC-exposed NSCs revealed that although these cells proliferated more than their ground control counterparts, a sub-population of them attempted to divide unsuccessfully.",
      "discussion": "It is well-accepted that normal mammalian cell division occurs by the mother cell giving rise to two daughter cells."
