      "introduction": "The perception of the gravity stimulus and the involvement of amyloplasts have long been the focus of plant biology because of the cryptic nature of essential steps in the response of a biological system to physical stimuli such as gravity.",
      "methods": "Brassica rapa, var. rapa seeds were commercially sourced. No approvals were required for the study, which complied with all relevant regulations.",
      "results": "Exposure to HGMF induced curvature. However, substantial curvature occurred in both presence and absence of magnetic gradients.",
      "discussion": "The comparison of space-grown or static ground control seedlings exposed to HGMF with seedlings grown in the non-magnetic field chamber shows strong correspondence between the two conditions."
