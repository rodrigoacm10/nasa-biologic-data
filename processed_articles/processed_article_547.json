    "abstract": "In an ongoing microbial tracking investigation of the International Space Station (ISS), several Sphingomonas strains were isolated.",

      "introduction": "Sphingomonas species are found in a variety of habitats, including soil, marine sediments, wastewater, and freshwater, in addition to the habitats contaminated with dyes, herbicides, and other pollutants (1â€“3).",
      "methods": "Sample collection and processing, followed by WGS and assembly that led to the isolation of Sphingomonas strains, are described elsewhere (25, 63).",
      "results": "Among the cultivable bacteria, three colonies obtained from ISS surfaces (IIF7SW-B3A and IIF7SW-B5) and one from KSC (FKI-L5-BR-P1) were identified as Sphingomonas species.",
      "discussion": "This study shows the identification of putative PGPFs in Sphingomonas strains isolated from the ISS or in a cleanroom where spacecraft are assembled."
