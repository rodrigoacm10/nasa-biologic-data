    "abstract": "To assess the potential of electrical impedance myography (EIM) to serve as a marker of muscle fiber atrophy and secondarily as an indicator of bone deterioration by assessing the effects of spaceflight or hind limb unloading.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Exposure to prolonged disuse or microgravity produces a variety of effects on skeletal muscle, including fiber atrophy, a reduction in maximal force, and reduced endurance1. For example, given the major alterations that can ensue even after just several days of exposure to microgravity, human spaceflight currently requires astronauts to participate in daily exercise countermeasures to help offset the effects of weightlessness2.",
      "methods": "For both the hind limb unloading (HLU) and spaceflight experiments, we used 9-week-old female C57Bl/6N mice (Charles River, Wilmington, MA).",
      "results": "As anticipated, mice exposed to spaceflight had a lower gastrocnemius muscle mass than ground controls, although the difference did not reach significance (102±32 mg for spaceflight; 112±22 mg for ground p=0.079).",
      "discussion": "These results support the hypothesis that significant alterations in the electrical impedance of mouse muscle occur after exposure to both spaceflight and hind limb unloading, consistent with our earlier in vivo observations seen in humans following disuse due to casting16 and rats undergoing hind limb unloading17."
