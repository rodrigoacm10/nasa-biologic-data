    "abstract": "The opportunistic pathogen Staphylococcus aureus encounters a wide variety of fluid shear levels within the human host, and they may play a key role in dictating whether this organism adopts a commensal interaction with the host or transitions to cause disease.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Fluctuations in fluid shear are encountered by pathogenic microorganisms as they occupy various host sites throughout the course of infection and/or during colonization (46). This is especially true for the opportunistic pathogen Staphylococcus aureus, which is able to adapt to and proliferate under a variety of environmental conditions, thus enabling high morbidity and mortality rates (32).",
      "methods": "Methicillin-resistant S. aureus N315 (kindly provided by Mark Shirtliff, University of Maryland Dental School) was used for all studies.",
      "results": "Visual examination of the LSMMG and control cultures of N315 indicated much greater levels of clumping in the LSMMG cultures.",
      "discussion": "The persisting bacteria that find benefit in colonization of a host also find benefit in forming biofilms (67)."
