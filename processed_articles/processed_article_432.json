      "introduction": "Reduction in mechanical loading occurs in many settings, including cast immobilization, extended bed rest, neuromuscular disorders, spinal cord injury, and spaceflight.",
      "methods": "Male Wistar rats (Charles River Laboratories Inc., Wilmington, MA, USA) weighing 408±0.15g (14 weeks of age) were obtained and housed in a temperature-controlled (22±2°C) room with a 12:12-h light–dark cycle.",
      "results": "In vivo longitudinal assessment of tibial metaphyseal trabecular bone density showed both load- and time-dependent effects of PWB (Fig. 1).",
      "discussion": "We hypothesized that partial reductions in mechanical loading would lead to proportional deteriorations in bone mass and structure in rats, and that deficits would be progressive with unloading duration."
