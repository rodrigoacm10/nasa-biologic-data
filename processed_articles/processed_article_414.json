    "abstract": "Astronauts have been previously shown to exhibit decreased salivary lysozyme and increased dental calculus and gingival inflammation in response to space flight, host factors that could contribute to oral diseases such as caries and periodontitis.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Streptococcus mutans is a primary causative agent of dental caries, demonstrated by its isolation from carious tooth lesions in humans,1 its ability to initiate caries in germ-free rodent models of infection,2 and the established link between high levels of this bacterium in the oral cavity and active caries.3 Although preventable by fluoridation of water and various dental procedures,4, caries remains the most common chronic disease among children, and remains untreated in up to 30% of adults over 35 years-old.5",
      "methods": "S. mutans UA15962 was used for all of the experiments described below. All S. mutans cultures (including HARV vessels) were grown at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator.",
      "results": "To probe the effect of simulated microgravity growth on S. mutans, continuous growth curves (whereby cell samples were removed from the same HARV at different time points) were performed (n = 3 independent experiments each) in biofilm media (BM) containing 11 mM glucose and 10 mM sucrose over a 24 h period.",
      "discussion": "Although the effects of both spaceflight and microgravity analog growth on virulence-related phenotypes of bacterial pathogens such as Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus have been well-described,28–38 comparatively little research has been dedicated to studying the specific effects of space flight and simulated microgravity on virulence attributes of oral bacteria such as S. mutans."
