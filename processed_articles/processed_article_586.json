    "abstract": "One of the major concerns for long-term exploration missions beyond the Earthâ€™s magnetosphere is consequences from exposures to solar particle event (SPE) protons and galactic cosmic rays (GCR). For long-term crewed Lunar and Mars explorations, the production of fresh food in space will provide both nutritional supplements and psychological benefits to the astronauts.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "A long-duration mission to Mars will require humans to live in space for up to 2.5 years. The distance of Mars from Earth changes with planetary physics limiting launch opportunities and preventing resupply.",
      "methods": "Seeds of wild type Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0, and Mizuna (Brassica rapa var. japonica), a mustard leafy green, were used for this study.",
      "results": "Irradiation of imbibed Arabidopsis seeds was delivered acutely (within minutes), or over a longer duration at a low dose rate (LDR) of 0.166 cGy/min for 40 cGy 300 MeV/n titanium ions (Ti), or 40 cGy 250 MeV/n protons.",
      "discussion": "For future missions back to the Moon or on to Mars, living organisms will be exposed constantly to GCR and occasionally to particles from large solar particle events (SPE), even with effective shielding from the structural materials of vehicles, surface bases, the Martian atmosphere, and the Moon and Mars themselves."

The results showed that the seeds were sensitive to radiation exposure, with heavier ions causing more severe damage.
