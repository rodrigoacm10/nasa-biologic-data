    "abstract": "The root apex is an important region involved in environmental sensing, but comprises a very small part of the root. Obtaining root apex transcriptomes is therefore challenging when the samples are limited. The feasibility of using tiny root sections for transcriptome analysis was examined, comparing RNA sequencing (RNA‐Seq) to microarrays in characterizing genes that are relevant to spaceflight.",

      "introduction": "",
      "methods": "Arabidopsis thaliana Columbia ecotype (Col‐0) seedlings were grown on sterile solid media plates composed of 2.2 g of Murashige and Skoog (MS) salts, 0.5 g of MES hydrate, 5.0 g of sucrose, and 1.0 mL of Gamborg vitamins (Sigma‐Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri, USA), and then adjusted to pH 5.72 with 1 M KOH. The media was solidified with 0.5% (w/v) Phytagel (Sigma‐Aldrich). The plates were vertically oriented in growth chambers with continuous light (80–100 μmol s−2m−2) at a constant temperature of 19°C.",
      "results": "Transcriptome data were obtained from the two root tip zones (Fig. 1) through both microarray and RNA‐Seq. A total of approximately 33,500 and 22,700 genes were detected as expressed in the root zones from RNA‐Seq and microarray, respectively (Gene Expression Omnibus [GEO] accession GSE115555).",
      "discussion": "In research studies that require the use of small tissue samples, or where samples are a limiting factor, it is especially important to be able to extract as much data as possible from minimal sample material."
