      "introduction": "Drosophila is well studied as a model of innate immunity in humans and has been instrumental in establishing principles of defense and gene signaling pathways that involve both immune induction and hematopoiesis (Lemaitre and Hoffmann 2007).",
      "methods": "Oregon R flies were used as the standard wild-type strain.",
      "results": "The original dappled alleles, dpld EJL and dpld MLB, result from the P-element insertions (P-lacW) in strains 142/2 (k14202) and 97/16 (k09716), respectively (Rodriguez et al. 1996).",
      "discussion": "We have identified dappled as a member of the conserved, ubiquitous cytochrome b5 family."
