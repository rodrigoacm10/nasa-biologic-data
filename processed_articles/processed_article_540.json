    "sections": {
      "introduction": "The genus Methylobacterium contains more species than any other genera within the family Methylobacteriaceae, order Rhizobiales, and class Alphaproteobacteria (Kelly et al., 2014).",
      "methods": "Several surface samples (1 m2) were collected from the ISS during Microbial Tracking–1 flight experiments from 2015 to 2016.",
      "results": "This study reports the isolation and identification of four strains belonging to the family Methylobacteriaceae, collected from different locations on the ISS.",
      "discussion": "The sequence similarity of these three ISS strains with validly described Methylobacterium species was <99.4% for 16S rRNA gene (Supplementary Table 1) and <97.3% for gyrB gene with the closest being M. indicum SE2.11T."
