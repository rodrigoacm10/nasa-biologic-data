    "abstract": "Apoptosis plays an important role in atrophy and sarcopenia in skeletal muscle. Recent evidence suggests that insufficient heat shock proteins (HSPs) may contribute to apoptosis and muscle wasting. In addition, long-term caloric restriction (CR) and lifelong wheel running exercise (WR) with CR provide significant protection against caspase-dependent apoptosis and sarcopenia. Caspase-independent mediators (endonuclease G: EndoG; apoptosis-inducing factor: AIF) of apoptosis are also linked to muscles wasting with disuse and aging. However, the efficacy of CR and WR with CR to attenuate caspase-independent apoptosis and preserve HSPs in aging skeletal muscle are unknown.",

      "introduction": "Skeletal muscles in mammals suffer from a progressive loss of muscle mass and function with advancing age, a process known as sarcopenia. The mechanisms responsible for sarcopenia are believed to be multi-factorial. From an epidemiological standpoint, impaired neuromuscular (e.g., loss of β-motor neurons) and endocrine (e.g., low testosterone, growth hormone, thyroxine levels, and increased insulin resistance) function, poor nutritional status, and physical inactivity have all been implicated (Dreyer and Volpi 2005; Lee and others 2007; Szulc and others 2004). At the cellular level, a host of etiological candidates driving sarcopenia include apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, and insufficient stress response including heat shock proteins (HSPs) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) (Jensen 2008; Marzetti and others 2008b).",
      "methods": "Male Fischer 344 rats were purchased from the Harlan colony (Indianapolis, IN) at 10–11 weeks of age. Animal Care Services facilities and all procedures had been approved by the University of Florida’s Institute on Animal Care and Use Committee. All rats were singly housed in a pathogen-free conditioned room in a temperature 20±2.5°C, and kept on a room with a 12h light: 12h dark diurnal cycle. Water and rat chow (Harlan Teklad Rodent Diet #8604) composed of a high protein (24.5%), carbohydrate including hemicelluloses (46.6%), low fat (4.4%), vitamins and minerals were given to animals and food intake for the caloric restricted groups and wheel running + caloric restriction groups was reduced by 8% below compared with age-matched ad libitum group.",
      "results": "We quantified EndoG and AIF protein levels in the plantaris muscle of the YAL, OAL, OCR, and OExCR rats. The protein abundance for EndoG in the soluble (mitochondrial) fraction was not different in old control (OAL; +17%) compared with young control (YAL). Further, EndoG was not affected by caloric restriction and lifelong wheel running (Figure 1A). However, there was a striking increase (+153%, p<0.001) in EndoG protein level in nucleosome fraction with age in the ad libitum group (Figure 1B). When we tested the effectiveness of long-term interventions, 8% caloric restriction attenuated the age-associated increase in the levels of EndoG in nuclear fraction (−38%, p=0.002). In addition, lifelong wheel running exercise with mild caloric restriction also mitigated upregulation of nuclear EndoG levels (−46%, p<0.001). Thus mild caloric restriction and exercise with caloric restriction may slow or prevent age-induced increase in pro-apoptotic EndoG signaling by limiting translocation from cytosol to nucleus.",
      "discussion": "The main objective of this study was to examine the effect of lifelong mild caloric restriction and voluntary wheel running exercise with caloric restriction on caspase-independent apoptosis. We also determined whether age-associated dysregulation of heat shock proteins is a potential protective mechanism against age-induced elevation of caspase-independent apoptotic signaling in skeletal muscle. A primary finding was that both lifelong mild caloric restriction and wheel running exercise with caloric restriction effectively abrogated age-induced translocation or accumulation of EndoG in the nucleus. This is highly novel data, suggesting that part of the amelioration of apoptosis by caloric restriction and long-term exercise demonstrated previously in the literature (Marzetti and others 2008b) is linked to prevention of nuclear EndoG accumulation in skeletal muscle nuclei."
