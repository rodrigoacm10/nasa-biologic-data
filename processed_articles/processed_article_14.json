    "abstract": "SNAREs play an important role in the process of membrane trafficking. In the present research, we investigated subcellular localization of an uncharacterized Arabidopsis thaliana protein reported to interact with a trans-Golgi network-localized Qa-SNARE, SYNTAXIN OF PLANTS 43.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "An efficient and well-organized intracellular transport system is a basic requirement for life to exist, as many components necessary for metabolic processes, that take place inside or outside of a eukaryotic cell, are produced and subsequently modified in different cell compartments.",
      "methods": "For colocalization observations, Arabidopsis plants were grown in growth chamber, in 22°C in long-day light (16 h/8 h, L/D) conditions on MS medium w/vitamins (Duchefa Biochemie), containing 0.3% gellan gum (Wako) and 2% sucrose.",
      "results": "AtGTLP is predicted to be a membrane-anchored protein comprising of 568 residues.",
      "discussion": "In our subcellular localization study, we found that AtGTLP colocalized well with the trans-Golgi marker, ST, as well as with the Golgi marker, GOS12."
