    "abstract": "Bacterial behavior has been studied under microgravity conditions, but very little is known about it under lunar and Martian gravitational regimes. An Earth-based approach was designed and implemented using inclined clinostats and an in-house-developed code to determine the optimal clinorotation angular speed for bacterial liquid cultures of 5 RPM.",

      "introduction": "Humans carry roughly as many bacterial cells in and on our bodies as we have total mammalian cells [1]. By the nature of this, we will ubiquitously share space habitats with bacteria. Hence, it is important to understand how an altered gravitational environment may affect bacterial behavior and, in the context of human health concerns, the efficacy of antibiotics.",
      "methods": "E. coli AMG1 and its mutant strain were cultured in modified artificial urine medium supplemented with glucose and a high concentration of phosphate (mAUMg hi-Pi) [5,44] to replicate human urine.",
      "results": "We used our MATLAB code to simulate and subsequently determine how long it would take a non-motile bacterial cell to leave a depletion zone of 10 µm in diameter as a function of rotational speed and vessel diameter.",
      "discussion": "A clinostat may replicate certain aspects of the quiescent extracellular environment experienced in actual microgravity, but it is not the same as microgravity, as it operates on Earth, and thus weightlessness is not achieved."
