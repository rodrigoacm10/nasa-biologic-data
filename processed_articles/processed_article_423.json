    "abstract": "Skeletal muscle size and strength are important for overall health for astronauts. However, how male and female muscle may respond differently to micro- and partial-gravity environments is not fully understood.",

      "introduction": "Skeletal muscle strength is critical for operational health and safety for astronauts upon the International Space Station and future missions to the Moon and Mars.",
      "methods": "Overall design: All experimental procedures were approved by the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC, protocol number: 081–2020).",
      "results": "F-SHAM-0g had similar bodyweight losses compared to M-SHAM-0g (Fig. 1A).",
      "discussion": "Our study builds on prior research in this domain8, 9, 10, 11 and concurs with prior literature finding females appear more susceptible to disuse atrophy relative to males."
