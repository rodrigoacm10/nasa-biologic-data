    "abstract": "Past results have suggested that bacterial antibiotic susceptibility is altered during space flight. To test this notion, Bacillus subtilis cells were cultivated in matched hardware, medium, and environmental conditions either in space flight microgravity on the International Space Station, termed flight (FL) samples, or at Earth-normal gravity, termed ground control (GC) samples.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "In physical terms, the space flight environment (e.g., microgravity, radiation, etc.), causes a number of changes in a microbial cell's immediate surroundings, such as the loss of convective mass and heat transfer and a reduction in mechanical shear force.",
      "methods": "The bacterium used was B. subtilis strain 168 from our laboratory stock collection.",
      "results": "Using Omnilog phenotype microarray (PM) plates PM-11C, PM-12B, and PM-13B (Table 1), triplicate B. subtilis flight (FL) and ground control (GC) samples were screened for their resistance to 72 antibiotics and growth inhibitors.",
      "discussion": "Understanding the development of bacterial antibiotic resistance in the human space flight environment is relevant to long-term human missions to distant exploration targets such as asteroids or Mars."
