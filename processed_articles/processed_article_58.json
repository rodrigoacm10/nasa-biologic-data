    "abstract": "Spaceflight has several detrimental effects on the physiology of astronauts, many of which are recapitulated in rodent models. Mouse studies performed on the Space Shuttle showed disruption of lipid metabolism in liver. However, given that these animals were not sacrificed on-orbit and instead returned live to earth, it is unclear if these disruptions were solely induced by space stressors (e.g. microgravity, space radiation) or in part explained by the stress of return to Earth.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Spaceflight affects several physiological and biochemical processes in astronauts and rodent models. The most reported changes from the space environment are in muscle and bone loss1,2. Several studies also indicate that spaceflight affects components of the immune system, including the distribution and functionality of peripheral leukocytes, and activity of cytokines3. In addition, several decades of spaceflight investigations have eluded that there are subclinical diabetogenic changes that happen in microgravity4.",
      "methods": "The omics data for the mouse liver samples were obtained from NASA’s GeneLab public omics repository (https://genelab.nasa.gov/)19–21 from previous experiments performed by previous investigators from three spaceflight missions, Rodent Research-1 (RR-1) (with samples from both NASA and CASIS)58,59, and Rodent Research-3 (RR-3)60 and STS-13561.",
      "results": "To assess the severity of steatosis and inflammation, liver samples were stained in hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and ORO and analyzed by light microscopy and digital image analysis (DIA)22 (Fig. 1A).",
      "discussion": "The current investigation demonstrates fluctuations in the temporal patterns of biochemical signal transduction pathways caused by microgravity in three distinct spaceflight datasets (RR1-NASA, RR1-CASIS and RR3) involving RNA-seq and proteomics data analysis compared to microarray data from STS-135."
