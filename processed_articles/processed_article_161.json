      "introduction": "Degenerative joint disease affects twenty million adults with an economic burden of over $40 billion per year in the US[1]. Once damaged, adult human articular cartilage has a limited capacity for intrinsic repair[2] and hence injuries can lead to progressive damage, joint degeneration, pain, and disability.",
      "methods": "A custom-built loom[19] was used to weave PCL multi-filament yarns (24 µm diameter per filament; 44 filaments/yarn, Grilon KE-60, EMS/Griltech, Domat, Switzerland) in three orthogonal directions (x-warp, y-weft, and a vertical z-direction) (Figure 1A).",
      "results": "Scaffold structure did not have any significant effect on the amounts of DNA, total collagen, or GAG in constructs cultured statically for 21 days in DM1 (Table 2, Group A vs. B).",
      "discussion": "The findings of this study demonstrate the ability to produce functional tissue engineered cartilage starting from hMSC and a tightly woven PCL scaffold within 21 days in vitro."
