      "introduction": "As humans become a space-faring species, they must confront the dual and long-term challenges of microgravity and radiation. Robust immune physiology and intact genomes are vital to the success of manned space exploration efforts. Animals and plants harbor a diverse array of microbial and metazoan pathogens and parasites. While the effects of the space environment in low Earth orbit are documented on many host species, with a focus on humans,1 the effects of space on the accompanying pathogens and parasites are not known.",
      "methods": "",
      "results": "Lb and Lh females attack their larval hosts, introducing one or more egg and venom into the host’s body cavity. Depending on the host’s ability to defend itself and the wasp’s ability to overcome host defenses, one of the two insects emerges alive from the host’s puparium (Figure 1A).",
      "discussion": "American scientists first launched fruit flies into space in 1947, and since then more than 20 spaceflight experiments with fruit flies have been conducted.4 Even parasitic wasps have been to space: in 1967, Biosatellite II carried Habrobracon juglandis into space.53"
