    "abstract": "Planning long-term space flights necessarily includes issues of providing food for the crew. One of the areas of research is the development of technologies for independent production of food by the crew. Extensive research on lettuce has confirmed that the “space production” of lettuce is not inferior to that on Earth, even in the absence of gravity, but the same deep understanding of the quality of grain crops has not yet been achieved.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "When planning piloting beyond our planet and long-term space exploration, the possibility of obtaining food in a new place is taken into account, because delivery to Mars, the Moon, or a space station will be unreasonably high in cost, long, and irregular [1].",
      "methods": "For the study, spring wheat of the Super Dwarf cultivar (Triticum aestivum L., 2n = 42) was used.",
      "results": "The wheat plants obtained during the full-size experiment on the ISS and in the ground laboratory Lada greenhouse were harvested after reaching the full maturity stage.",
      "discussion": "Providing for people during long space expeditions, when working on remote objects of deep and near space, poses significant challenges for agronomic support and necessarily encourage the creation of water reclamation systems, efficient use of nutrients, and a closed cycle of plant cultivation with mandatory reproduction of plant crops from seed to seed [6,19]."
