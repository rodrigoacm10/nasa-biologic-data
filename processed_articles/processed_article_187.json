    "abstract": "Exposure to ionizing radiation can cause rapid mineral loss and increase bone-resorbing osteoclasts within metabolically active, cancellous bone tissue leading to structural deficits.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "During a spaceflight beyond the Earth's protective magnetosphere, astronauts are exposed to a complex mixture of ionizing radiation (Durante and Cucinotta 2011), including low-linear energy transfer (LET) gamma rays and protons, as well as more damaging high-LET radiation.",
      "methods": "Post-pubescent (16 weeks±4 days at time of irradiation), male C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Laboratories) were individually housed and provided food (LabDiet 5001) and water ad libitum, as described elsewhere (Yumoto and others 2010).",
      "results": "To determine the extent of bone loss over the short term, mice were irradiated with 56Fe ions (600 MeV) or were sham irradiated (0 Gy controls), then 7 days later bones were harvested and cancellous microarchitecture in the proximal tibia quantified ex vivo using 3D microcomputed tomography.",
      "discussion": "To better understand the mechanisms underlying radiation-induced stimulation of bone resorption, we investigated molecular signals within the latency period between radiation exposure and the manifestation of cancellous tissue loss."
