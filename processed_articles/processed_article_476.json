    "abstract": "The mannose receptor C-type 1 (Mrc1) is a C-type lectin receptor expressed on the immune cells and sinusoidal endothelial cells (ECs) of several tissues, including the bone marrow (BM). Parallel to systemic metabolic alterations and hematopoietic cell proliferation, high-fat diet (HFD) feeding increases the expression of Mrc1 in sinusoidal ECs, thus calling for the investigation of its role in bone marrow cell reprogramming and the metabolic profile during obesity.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "The mannose receptor (Mrc1) is a unique type 1 transmembrane receptor that is a member of the C-type lectin family. Mrc1 can be located on non-vascular endothelium, macrophages [1], and dendritic cells [2] as well as in the serum in a shortened soluble form [3].",
      "methods": "Mrc1−/− mice on a C57BL/6J background were used and compared to age-matched C57BL/6J wild-type littermates.",
      "results": "The Mrc1−/− mice displayed a significant reduction in neutrophils (Figure 1A) and inflammatory CCR2+ monocyte counts (Figure 1B).",
      "discussion": "Metabolic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, are associated with increased hematopoiesis [27] and dysfunctional endothelium, which in turn contribute to disrupting myelopoiesis [17]."
