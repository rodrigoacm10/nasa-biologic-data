      "introduction": "The stages of skeletal muscle regeneration are well characterized following injury, starting with necrosis of damaged muscle tissue and the infiltration of immune cells (Frenette et al., 2000; Tidball, 2005). Inflammatory signals both directly and indirectly lead to activation of resident muscle stem cells (MuSCs; also called satellite cells), which respond to muscle damage by population expansion, followed by selective differentiation into myogenic progeny (Chazaud et al., 2003; Tidball and Wehling-Henricks, 2015).",
      "methods": "",
      "results": "To understand the mechanisms that affect telomere length and function in diseased MuSCs, we assayed their internal signaling pathways by flow cytometry (Table S1). We found that a higher proportion of the MuSCs from dystrophic mice exhibited higher NF-κB activation (Figure 1A) and accumulation of p-p65 (Figures 1B and 1C).",
      "discussion": "Previous work had revealed that MuSCs progressively become dysfunctional in dystrophy, and telomere shortening is a major hallmark of the disease (Dumont et al., 2015; Sacco et al., 2010; Tichy et al., 2017). Here, we provide evidence of the in vivo molecular basis for telomere shortening of stem cells under chronic injury conditions."
