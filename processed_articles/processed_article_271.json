    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Skeletal muscle is crucial for stability, mobility and whole body metabolism. As with all other organs, aging has a detrimental impact on skeletal muscle that can be observed phenotypically as atrophy, susceptibility to damage, fibrosis, and weakness.",
      "methods": "Male Fischer-344 rats were purchased from Harlan (Indianapolis, IN) at 10â€“11 weeks of age.",
      "results": "Fiber cross-sectional area (CSA) in the plantaris muscles was quantified following Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining.",
      "discussion": "In the current study, we report that lifelong mild (8%) caloric restriction (CR) and CR plus lifelong voluntary wheel running (WR) are interventions capable of partially preventing the age-associated decrease in plantaris muscle fiber cross-sectional area (CSA)."
