    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Bedrest, sedentary lifestyle, and isolation have negative effects on almost all systems of the human body, and understanding these effects has become a primary objective for enabling long-term space flights.",
      "methods": "Mice were assigned to one of four experimental groups (See Supplementary Figure S1; n = 8/group unless otherwise stated) and housed in a custom caging system as previously described [48].",
      "results": "Increased CD68 levels are indicative of increased microglial activation. Hippocampal sections were stained to visualize and quantify CD68 protein expression (Figure 1A).",
      "discussion": "The hippocampus is crucial for learning and memory, and any alterations in this region can have detrimental consequences on CNS function."
