    "abstract": "Control over phenoxy radical-radical coupling reactions in vivo in vascular plants was enigmatic until our discovery of dirigent proteins (DPs, from the Latin dirigere, to guide or align). The first three-dimensional structure of a DP ((+)-pinoresinol-forming DP, 1.95 Å resolution, rhombohedral space group H32)) is reported herein. It has a tightly packed trimeric structure with an eight-stranded β-barrel topology for each DP monomer. Each putative substrate binding and orientation coupling site is located on the trimer surface but too far apart for intermolecular coupling between sites. It is proposed that each site enables stereoselective coupling (using either two coniferyl alcohol radicals or a radical and a monolignol). Interestingly, there are six differentially conserved residues in DPs affording either the (+)- or (−)-antipodes in the vicinity of the putative binding site and region known to control stereoselectivity. DPs are involved in lignan biosynthesis, whereas dirigent domains/sites have been implicated in lignin deposition.",

      "introduction": "In terrestrial vascular plants, monolignol coupling affords the lignans (1), as well as the polymeric structural lignins (2), with the latter being the most abundant plant biopolymers next to cellulose. The former are, however, a very diverse class of vascular plant natural products, typically dimers and/or higher oligomers, whose physiological roles in planta are considered mainly involved in plant defense, particularly in leaf, (heart)wood, knot, and seed coat tissues. Many lignans are optically active and can have diverse coupling modes, although the 8–8′ interunit (dimer) linkage is perhaps the most commonly encountered (1). Some are also medicinally important, such as podophyllotoxin, or its semi-synthetic derivatives, etoposide, teniposide, and Etopophos® widely used in cancer therapies (1).",
      "methods": "The PsDRR206 gene (GenBankTM accession number U11716) was isolated from pea (P. sativum cv. Alcan) genomic DNA using PCR amplification with gene specific primers (DRR206 forward, ATGGGTTCCAAACTTCTAGTACTA, and DRR206 reverse, TTACCAACACTCAAAGAACTTGAT). Vector construction and transformation were carried out using biolistic bombardment technology as described by Seneviratne et al. (7), as was expression and purification of the (+)-pinoresinol-forming PsDRR206 recombinant DP in tomato cell culture.",
      "results": "Detailed biochemical characterization next established it to be a (+)-pinoresinol-forming DP (7), and a homologue to our much earlier discovery of this protein type and its physiological function from Forsythia species (3). Thus we have now discovered DPs producing both pinoresinol antipodes, with the recent discovery of a (−)-pinoresinol-forming DP in Arabidopsis (AtDIR6) (1, 5).",
      "discussion": "The study herein obtained the (+)-pinoresinol-forming DP (PsDRR206) in crystalline form, and at 1.95 Å resolution. In this regard, determination of the PsDRR206 three-dimensional structure, and its analysis suggests that the corresponding trimer has three identical substrate binding sites that are spatially distributed so that intermolecular coupling apparently cannot occur between two distinct substrate binding sites in the trimer model."
