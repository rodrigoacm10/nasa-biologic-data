    "abstract": "Liquid cultures have been commonly used in space, toxicology, and pharmacology studies of Caenorhabditis elegans. However, the knowledge about transcriptomic alterations caused by liquid cultivation remains limited. Moreover, the impact of different genotypes in rapid adaptive responses to environmental changes (e.g., liquid cultivation) is often overlooked.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "All living systems possess the fundamental property to regulate physical or genetic states in response to environmental stimuli. Caenorhabditis elegans offers one of the unique models to study the effects of environmental changes as it can reproduce in large numbers and has a natural ability to live in both solid and liquid conditions.",
      "methods": "Wild-type N2, wild-isolate AB1, and MD701 bcIs39 [lim-7p::ced-1::GFP + lin-15(+)] strains were obtained from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center (CGC). All animals were grown at 21 °C.",
      "results": "To induce an adaptive response and observe its sustained effects on the following generation, the P0 generation C. elegans was grown on agar, the F1 generation in liquid, and the F2 generation back on agar.",
      "discussion": "In this paper, we demonstrated that environment changes cause significant alterations in the transcriptional responses in a C. elegans model."
