    "abstract": "Over the past 30 years, organs-on-a-chip (OOCs) have emerged as a robust alternative to address the technological challenges associated with current in vitro and in vivo options. Although OOCs offer improved bio-relevance and controlled complexity, broad adoption has remained limited. Most approaches to characterize on-chip structure and function require human intervention, limiting device translation and feasibility. Here, we introduce a new fiber optic-based sensing platform that enables automated, temporal luminescence sensing on-chip, validated for real-time readout of epithelial and endothelial barrier function under cytokine-induced inflammation. Our platform, capable of at least 1 μM resolution, tracked paracellular transport in situ for 9 days of culture under perfusion on-chip. These results offer an alternative sensing approach for continuous, non-invasive luminescence monitoring in OOCs.",

      "introduction": "Organs-on-a-chip (OOCs) have significantly advanced human disease modelling and drug development, offering improved bio-relevance and controlled complexity by integrating physical and chemical stimuli matched to physiologically relevant conditions.1–4 Although significant innovations have been made toward recreating organ-specific physiology on chip, the methods available to study the structure and function of the cell microenvironment are still limited.5–7 Established analysis approaches, such as fluorescence microscopy, often rely on laborious offline workflows that yield acute or terminal time-point data.8,9 These complex techniques require substantial manual perturbations, frequently adding environmental and user-based variability to inherently inconsistent biological samples. As the OOC field continues to evolve, there is a unique opportunity to engineer improved in situ characterization methods into organ-chip devices. It is essential to develop novel approaches that address current limitations and enable real-time readout of relevant physiological parameters in OOCs to improve the reliability and robustness of these systems.",
      "methods": "Our fiber photometry platform consists of two CMOS cameras capable of imaging the proximal end of fiber optic patch cables, with filters and dichroic mirrors to isolate excitation and emission wavelengths. The optical setup was engineered for simultaneous dual-channel recording, enabling continuous monitoring of apical and basal organ-chip compartments by independent, duplicate optical components to isolate channel recordings.",
      "results": "Our previously established layer-by-layer gut-on-a-chip32,33 was adapted to add fiber optic insertion channels to the upper and lower fluidic layers (Fig. 1A and C). The 500 μm wide fiber channels were positioned at the outlets to detect the exit concentration of fluorophore from each fluidic layer.",
      "discussion": "The fiber photometry platform utilized for barrier sensing was assembled as a mirror"
