    "sections": {
      "introduction": "The middle ear contains the three auditory ossicles—the malleus, incus, and stapes—which sequentially conduct sound by transmitting sound vibrations from the tympanic membrane to the fluid in the cochlea via the oval window of the otic capsule, the bony case enclosing the cochlea and vestibular system.",
      "methods": "All animals were handled according to protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Duke University and at Weill Cornell Medical College.",
      "results": "We found that the auditory ossicles and the otic capsule of CaV1.2TS-expressing mutant mice were thicker and had more bone mass than those of the control mice, particularly at the malleus handle, the malleus bony membrane, the incus body, the footplate of stapes, the stapedial arch (especially the anterior and posterior crura), and the whole otic capsule.",
      "discussion": "Our data demonstrate that Ca2+ influx through CaV1.2 regulates development of the auditory ossicles and otic capsule."
