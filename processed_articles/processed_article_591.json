    "abstract": "Space flight exposes astronauts to stressors that alter the immune response, rendering them vulnerable to infections and diseases. In this study, we aimed to determine the levels of inflammasome activation in the brains of mice that were housed in the International Space Station (ISS) for 37 days.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Space flight exposes astronauts to a variety of stressors [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8] ranging from psychological to physical that stem from the environment they experience [9]. These environmental factors include gravity changes, radiation exposure, altered nutrition or altered circadian rhythms, all of which affect the immune response [10,11,12,13,14].",
      "methods": "C57BL/6 female mice (16-week-old, Jackson Labs) were flown to the ISS as part of RR-1 on SpaceX-4 CRS-4 Dragon cargo spacecraft [60].",
      "results": "Our findings indicate that caspase-1 (95% CI = Ground [1.06–5.9], Flight [0.3–2.3]) (Figure 2A), ASC (Ground [1.3–7.6], Flight [0.6–3.5]) (Figure 2B) and IL-1β (Ground [1.8–5.4], Flight [0.8–2.7]) (Figure 2C) were significantly decreased in the mice that were in the ISS when compared to the ground control group.",
      "discussion": "Previous studies have shown that the adaptive immune response is compromised as a result of space flight missions, resulting in the reactivation of viruses [68]."
