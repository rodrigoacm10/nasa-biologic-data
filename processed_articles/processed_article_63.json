    "abstract": "The utricle provides the vestibular reflex pathways with the sensory codes of inertial acceleration of self motion and head orientation with respect to gravity to control balance and equilibrium.",

      "introduction": "Vertebrates possess a highly conserved and elaborate gravito-inertial sensing system in the inner ear.",
      "methods": "Adult oyster toadfish, (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?id=8068) Opsanus tau, of both sexes and weighing ~400 gm were provided by the Marine Biological Laboratory (Woods Hole, MA) and shipped overnight to NASA Ames Research Center.",
      "results": "Individual utricular fibers were measured at the light microscopy level (40X oil magnification) in 6 fish where the AC and U nerves were clearly separate (see Fig. 1b), and their diameter averaged 5.4 ± 2.6 μm (SD; range 1.3 – 13.3 μm; n=1654).",
      "discussion": "As a prelude to our efforts to understand the impact of normal and altered gravitational environment(s) on the neurovestibular system it is essential to provide a detailed description of the general morphology of the utricular otolith in our selected model, the toadfish, to establish the benchmarks for reference."
