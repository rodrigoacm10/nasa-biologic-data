    "abstract": "The trans-Golgi network (TGN) is a dynamic organelle that functions as a relay station for receiving endocytosed cargo, directing secretory cargo, and trafficking to the vacuole. TGN-localized SYP41-interacting protein (TNO1) is a large, TGN-localized, coiled-coil protein that associates with the membrane fusion protein SYP41, a target SNARE, and is required for efficient protein trafficking to the vacuole.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "The trans-Golgi network (TGN) is a highly dynamic tubulo-vesicular organelle that matures from the two or three trans-most cisternae of the Golgi (Staehelin and Kang, 2008) and is crucial for endocytic, secretory and vacuolar trafficking routes in plant cells.",
      "methods": "Arabidopsis seeds were surface-sterilized in 33% bleach, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 20 min, rinsed five times with sterile water and kept in the dark at 4Â°C for at least 2 days.",
      "results": "Auxin signaling pathways are integral to LR development during root architecture establishment (Lavenus et al., 2013). Polar auxin transport mediates emergence of LRs from the primary axis, and several auxin transport mutants display slow rates of emergence (Hobbie and Estelle, 1995; Ruegger et al., 1997).",
      "discussion": "Auxin flow in plants is an important determinant of root architecture and tropic bending such as gravitropism. The polar transport of auxin depends on the specific localization of auxin transporters, which in turn is dependent on the cellular trafficking machinery."
