    "abstract": "Space travel is a growing area of interest and includes initiatives such as NASA’s Moon-to-Mars Mission. Reports on the cardiovascular effects of space travel reveal changes in morphology, metabolism, and function of the cardiovascular system. In this study, the cardiovascular response to immunization in space was studied in mice which were housed and immunized while on the International Space Station (ISS). Mice were immunized with tetanus toxoid combined with the adjuvant CpG (TT + CpG) and the effects of vaccination in space were studied using transcriptomics.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "The effects of microgravity and space-related radiation have the potential to impact astronaut health on long-duration missions. Indeed, human and animal model studies have already shown structural and/or functional deficits in the musculoskeletal system, the lymphatic and blood circulatory systems, and immune system after spaceflight [1–3]. Of particular concern is the impact of spaceflight on the cardiovascular system.",
      "methods": "Animal experiments were reviewed and approved by the NASA Flight Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (FIACUC) (protocol #RR-12). The experiments described here were a component of a larger investigation which was focused on the impact of immunization in the context of the spaceflight environment.",
      "results": "The transcriptomic changes induced in the heart following vaccination with tetanus toxoid plus the adjuvant CpG versus flight saline were identified using RNAseq (n = 3 per group) (Fig. 1a). The hearts of mice vaccinated in flight showed 658 upregulated and 472 downregulated transcripts (p < 0.01) when compared to flight saline mice (Fig. 1b).",
      "discussion": "In this study, we identified transcriptomic changes that occur in the mouse heart following immunization with TT + CpG in the spaceflight environment. A shift in cytokine expression and activation of the NF-κB pathway, leading to inflammation, occurred following vaccine administration."
