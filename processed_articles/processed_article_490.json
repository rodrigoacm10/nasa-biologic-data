    "abstract": "Muscle strength is a functional measure of quality of life in humans. Declines in muscle strength are manifested in diseases as well as during inactivity, aging, and space travel. With conserved muscle biology, the simple genetic model C. elegans is a high throughput platform in which to identify molecular mechanisms causing muscle strength loss and to develop interventions based on diet, exercise, and drugs.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Skeletal muscle provides the contractile system critical for animal locomotion across phyla. The conserved biology of muscle includes sarcomere composition and organization, the calcium-initiated contractile mechanism, and the ATP-driven translocation of actin and myosin for force generation1, 2. A powerful indicator of muscle health is strength —a measure of maximum force that can be voluntarily exerted for a given task.",
      "methods": "C. elegans were maintained on E. coli OP50 bacterial lawns using standard protocol31. Wild-type (WT) animals were Bristol isolate (N2). Other strains used in this study were unc-52(e669), unc-112(r367ts)V, unc-17(e245), and lon-2(e678)X.",
      "results": "At the core of the NemaFlex technology is a liquid-filled microfluidic chamber containing elastic micropillars dangling from the chamber roof that can be deformed by a nematode push (Fig. 1c, d). As C. elegans threads through the pillars, the individual pillar deflections Δ are quantified using a microscope-camera system and image analysis (see Supplementary Movie 2).",
      "discussion": "Here we have optimized the micropillar forest design, defined the measurement conditions, and fine-tuned the workflow analysis so that NemaFlex can reliably score the maximum exertable force in C. elegans."
