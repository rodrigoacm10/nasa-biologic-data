    "abstract": "Men and women have different cardiovascular responses to spaceflight; however, few studies have focused on direct comparisons between sexes. We investigated the mechanisms of aortic stiffening in socially and sexually mature 20-week-old male and female Sprague Dawley (SD) rats exposed to hindlimb unloading (HLU) for 14 days.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "The cardiovascular adaptations in astronauts both during and after spaceflight are variable in terms of sex, duration of exposure, and the model used for the studies.",
      "methods": "The study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Wake Forest University School of Medicine (A21-039).",
      "results": "The body weight of male control rats was significantly (p < 0.05) greater than the body weight of female control rats (Fig. 1).",
      "discussion": "Recent studies highlighted the incidence of arterial stiffness in astronauts following spaceflight. The exposure of rodents to ground-based analogs of microgravity via HLU also demonstrated development of arterial stiffness."
