      "introduction": "The International Space Exploration Coordination Group, representing 27 of Earth’s space agencies, has outlined a clear target for a crewed mission to Mars in the Global Exploration Roadmap1,2, and sustainable long-term lunar exploration as a platform to develop the capabilities necessary to enable this ambitious goal.",
      "methods": "Female 32 weeks-old C57BL/6NTac mice (Taconic Biosciences sources) from four treatment groups of the Rodent Research 6 mission were compared: flight live animal return (FLT_LAR), ground control for live animal return (GC_LAR), flight ISS (FLT_ISS) and ground control for ISS (GC_ISS) (Fig. 1).",
      "results": "Four treatment groups from a single cohort of 32 weeks-old female mice included two spaceflight groups flown to the ISS on SpaceX-13: FLT_LAR, returned to Earth after 29 days of spaceflight as part of the Live Animal Return mission, and FLT_ISS, sampled on the ISS by the crew after 56 days of spaceflight.",
      "discussion": "A challenge for biological experimentation conducted in space is low replication, compared to model studies using mice on Earth."
