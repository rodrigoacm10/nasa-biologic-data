    "abstract": "Astronauts exhibit an assortment of clinical abnormalities in their eyes during long-duration spaceflight. The purpose of this study was to determine whether spaceflight induces epigenomic and transcriptomic reprogramming in the retina or alters the epigenetic clock.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "The spaceflight environment contains two major risk factors, irradiation and microgravity, which are thought to induce adverse effects on astronautsâ€™ vision and central nervous systems, and in particular, the eye and retina.",
      "methods": "The 16-week-old female C57 BL/6J mice were used in this study as part of the NASA RR-1 project consortium.",
      "results": "We found that a large number of genes were differentially methylated with spaceflight, whereas there were fewer differentially expressed genes at the transcriptome level.",
      "discussion": "Results from the present study of spaceflight-induced alterations in DNA methylome and transcriptome demonstrated that retinal cell homeostasis was disrupted during spaceflight,"
