    "sections": {
      "introduction": "The impact of radiation on astronaut health, especially during extended deep-space missions, continues to be a significant concern to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).",
      "methods": "C57BL/6 J female mice (n = 60) were purchased from Charles River Breeding Laboratories, Wilmington, MA, USA, and shipped directly to BNL at 8–9 weeks of age.",
      "results": "Figure 1 shows results for body and thymus masses. There were significant differences in thymus mass alone or when normalized to body mass.",
      "discussion": "Body mass is considered to be an indicator of overall health. In our study, there was no effect of 56Fe radiation on body mass at the 40-day post-exposure time-point."
