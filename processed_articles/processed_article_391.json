      "introduction": "Exploration missions to the Moon and Mars would expose astronauts to environmental challenges, including gravitational changes, ionizing radiation, altered circadian rhythm, elevated CO2, and isolation. Human acclimation to these environments presents complex health effects, with acute and prolonged consequences in multiple tissues that may result in increased risk to crew health and performance during the mission (Afshinnekoo et al., 2020; Crucian et al., 2015; Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019; Grimm et al., 2016; Indo et al., 2016; Kononikhin et al., 2017; Wilson et al., 2018). With a high concentration of oxidizable, unsaturated lipids, low levels of antioxidant defenses, and high energy demand, the central nervous system (CNS) is particularly vulnerable to space stressors, with studies reporting behavioral deficits in spatial orientation, coordination, and locomotion, as well as cognition (Cekanaviciute et al., 2018; Clément et al., 2020, Salim, 2017, Friedman, 2011).",
      "methods": "",
      "results": "The ISS is a useful environment for studying the effects of spaceflight by combining a μg environment with ionizing radiation and CO2 levels that are elevated compared to Earth’s surface (McDonald et al., 2020). The MVP-Fly-01 validation mission (34 days) has enabled comprehensive investigations of the fly CNS (Figure 1A).",
      "discussion": "Deep space exploration will expose space travelers to several environmental challenges, thereby altering the homeostatic equilibrium of various physiological systems, including the CNS. Understanding the risks to CNS and identifying countermeasures to mitigate these risks in astronauts will be crucial to ensure the success of missions to the Moon and Mars."
