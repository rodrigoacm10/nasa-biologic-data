    "abstract": "It may take decades to develop cardiovascular dysfunction following exposure to high doses of ionizing radiation from medical therapy or from nuclear accidents. Since astronauts may be exposed continually to a complex space radiation environment unlike that experienced on Earth, it is unresolved whether there is a risk to cardiovascular health during long-term space exploration missions.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "We recently reported on long term functional changes to the heart following a single dose of GCR5-ion (Bishawi et al., 2022). Physiologically, this dysfunction was manifested as changes in arterial elastance, and histologically, there was evidence of elastin fragmentation in the aorta.",
      "methods": "Approximately 24-week old male C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Labs) were exposed to 150 cGy GCR5-ion (H 1,000 MeV/n, 28Si 600 MeV/n, 4He 250 MeV/n, 16O 350 MeV/n, 56Fe 600 MeV/n, and H 250 MeV/n) using the beam line at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at BNL (Simonsen et al., 2020).",
      "results": "For the heart proteome, there were 87 significant DEPs (Supplementary Table S1); for the heart phosphoproteome, there were 60 significant differentially phosphorylated peptides (Supplementary Table S3); and for the plasma proteome, there was only one upregulated protein (Supplementary Table S2).",
      "discussion": "Based on data from epidemiological studies, it takes a significant amount of time for cardiovascular disease to develop (up to decades). There is relatively little knowledge regarding the time frame to develop cardiovascular disease from exposure to the space radiation environment."
