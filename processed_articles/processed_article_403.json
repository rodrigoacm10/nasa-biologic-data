    "abstract": "The phosphoinositide pathway and inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate (InsP3) have been implicated in plant responses to many abiotic stresses; however, their role in response to biotic stress is not well characterized.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Plants have developed a multilayered strategy to effectively control and combat pathogen invasion (Jones and Dangl, 2006). The first line of defense is triggered by the recognition of microbial- or pathogen-associated molecular patterns (MAMP or PAMP) by the membrane associated pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) (NÃ¼rnberger et al., 2004; Delledonne, 2005).",
      "methods": "Transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing the human type I inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase generated via Agrobacterium mediated transformation were generated previously (Perera et al., 2006).",
      "results": "The bacterial elicitor flagellin is a well characterized MAMP used to investigate plant innate immunity responses.",
      "discussion": "A summary of our major results is illustrated in Figure 6. In the InsP 5-ptase plants, PTI responses including MAMP-triggered Ca2+ increase and gene expression were affected, although ROS generation was normal."
