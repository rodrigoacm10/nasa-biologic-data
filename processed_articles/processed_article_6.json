Cardiac deconditioning and atrophy on Earth are associated with altered Trp53 and oxidative stress-related pathways, but the effects of spaceflight on cardiac changes at the molecular level are less understood.",

      "introduction": "Responses to spaceflight include cardiovascular deficits, loss of bone and muscle mass, compromised immune function, chromosomal aberrations and metabolic changes [1,2,3]. With future lunar and interplanetary space missions, astronauts will stay in space for longer periods, presenting increased cardiovascular risk to the crew.",
      "methods": "All animal procedures were conducted in accordance with guidelines described by the National Institute of Health Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and approved by all relevant committees, including the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Ames Research Center.",
      "results": "Immediately after landing, all flight (FLT) and ground (GRD) control mice were determined to be in good condition by veterinary examination.",
      "discussion": "Our findings provide new insight into how the heart responds at the molecular level to the novel environment of space."
