    "abstract": "Spaceflight is a unique environment that includes at least two factors which can negatively impact skeletal health: microgravity and ionizing radiation. We have previously shown that a diet supplemented with dried plum powder (DP) prevented radiation-induced bone loss in mice. In this study, we investigated the capacity of the DP diet to prevent bone loss in mice following exposure to simulated spaceflight, combining microgravity (by hindlimb unloading) and radiation exposure.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Alterations in the gravity vector and exposure to ionizing radiation can disrupt skeletal homeostasis in mice1–3. There are multiple stressors associated with spaceflight, including microgravity and radiation which are known to cause bone loss4–6.",
      "methods": "Male C57BL/6 J mice (Jackson Labs, Sacramento, CA) at 14 weeks of age were weight matched, assigned to groups (n = 10/group), and individually housed in standard vivarium cages or custom-designed HU cages as previously described46.",
      "results": "Skeletally mature, male mice, 14 weeks of age, were assigned to groups (n = 10/group) and pre-fed for 14 days with either a control diet (CD) or dried plum diet (DP) (Fig. 1).",
      "discussion": "In this study, we investigated the bone protective potential of DP against independent and combined effects of simulated microgravity and ionizing radiation on the microarchitecture and mechanical properties of skeletal tissue."
