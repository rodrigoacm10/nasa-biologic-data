    "abstract": "Tardigrades, microscopic animals that survive a broad range of environmental stresses, express a unique set of proteins termed tardigrade-specific intrinsically disordered proteins (TDPs). TDPs are often expressed at high levels in tardigrades upon desiccation, and appear to mediate stress adaptation.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Water is the universal solvent essential for survival. However, several organisms demonstrate remarkable abilities to withstand an almost complete loss of water for a prolonged time and recover upon rehydration1,2. This phenomenon of “anhydrobiosis”, or “life without water” has attracted a great deal of attention because it may reveal Nature’s strategies to endure adverse environments and open up ways to achieve efficient preservation of living matter.",
      "methods": "SAHS protein sequences used for expression in E. coli (Figure S2) were obtained from Uniprot database (https://www.uniprot.org). Protein subcellular localization and signal peptides were predicted using TargetP 2.0 server available at https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk18.",
      "results": "We selected 12 SAHS proteins from R. varieornatus and one from H. exemplaris to test for expression in the E. coli cytoplasm (Table S1). R. varieornatus is the most desiccation-resistant tardigrade and is well-characterized; a draft genome sequence is available, and crystal structures of two SAHS proteins from this organism have been solved16,17.",
      "discussion": "In this study, we tested the proteins belonging to the SAHS family of tardigrade proteins for their potential to protect diverse biological structures. In addition, we observed that the SAHS proteins undergo structural shift upon exposure to a desiccation-mimicking compound and used a diverse set of experimental and computational approaches to suggest possible models of how the structural transition of SAHS proteins might occur to protect biological structures."
