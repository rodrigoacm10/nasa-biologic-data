    "abstract": "Increased oxidative stress is an unavoidable consequence of exposure to the space environment. Our previous studies showed that mice exposed to space for 13.5 days had decreased glutathione levels, suggesting impairments in oxidative defense. Here we performed unbiased, unsupervised and integrated multi-‘omic analyses of metabolomic and transcriptomic datasets from mice flown aboard the Space Shuttle Atlantis. Enrichment analyses of metabolite and gene sets showed significant changes in osmolyte concentrations and pathways related to glycerophospholipid and sphingolipid metabolism, likely consequences of relative dehydration of the spaceflight mice. However, we also found increased enrichment of aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis and purine metabolic pathways, concomitant with enrichment of genes associated with autophagy and the ubiquitin-proteasome. When taken together with a downregulation in nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2-mediated signaling, our analyses suggest that decreased hepatic oxidative defense may lead to aberrant tRNA post-translational processing, induction of degradation programs and senescence-associated mitochondrial dysfunction in response to the spaceflight environment.",

      "introduction": "Long-duration spaceflight is associated with significant risks including prolonged exposure to microgravity, continuous exposure to low-dose/low-dose rate radiation, psychological and environmental stress and contact with potentially dangerous levels of microbial contamination [1,2,3,4,5]. Radiation is known to induce single (SSB) and double strand (DSB) DNA breaks, permanently damaging nuclear and mitochondrial DNA and leading to early apoptosis or necrosis [6,7,8]. At low-dose/low-dose rates, radiation immediately triggers oxidative stress via a spike in the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Acute psychological stress increases hepatic lipid peroxidation as well as levels of ROS [9], however chronically stressed animals compensate [9,10]. Therefore, exposure to the space environment, characterized by changes in physiological and psychological stress, as well as exposure to low-dose/low-dose rate radiation, may systemically alter ROS levels in a complex fashion [11,12,13].",
      "methods": "Nine-week old weight-matched female C57BL/6J mice were selected for this study because they produce fewer odor annoyance issues and were the only gender approved for flight (n = 15/group). Additionally, all historical data (e.g., STS-118) were obtained on female mice so the use of female mice permitted comparisons across missions, particularly for the musculoskeletal studies that were primary. Mice were housed in Animal Enclosure Modules (AEMs, 10 mice per AEM habitat; 5 per side separated by a wire mesh) and either flown on the Space Shuttle Atlantis (STS-135) for 13.5 days (FLT) or housed at the Space Life Science Laboratory (SLSL) at KSC (Ground AEM controls; AEM).",
      "results": "Brief exposure to the space environment results in significant metabolite changes in mouse liver. (A) PLS-DA analysis was performed on normalized metabolomics data that was subsequently log-transformed and auto-scaled. The first two components are plotted; (B) volcano plot comparing flown in space (FLT) vs. matched ground controls (AEM) considering unequal variance and using a fold change (FC) threshold of 2 and a p (corr)-value threshold of 0.05. Data points in red indicate significant named biochemical features.",
      "discussion": "The unbiased analyses presented here both support our previous results and extend them to show that exposure to the space environment for only 13.5 days results in increased oxidative stress due to elevated ROS and impaired oxidative defense (by way of attenuation of NRF2-related pathways) in the mouse liver. Furthermore, our multi-‘omics studies suggest that accumulation of oxidized proteins coupled with mitochondrial dysfunction may lead to activation of hepatocyte senescence, resulting in hepatocyte lipid accumulation and steatosis."
