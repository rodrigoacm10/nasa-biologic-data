    "abstract": "Although heat and desiccation stresses often coincide, the response to heat especially in desiccation tolerant plants is rarely studied. We subjected hydrated Pleopeltis polypodioides fronds to temperatures up to 50°C and dehydrated fronds up to 65°C for 24 h. The effect of heat stress was evaluated using morphological changes, photosystem (PS) II efficiency, and metabolic indicators.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Heat stress is one of the major abiotic stresses limiting plant growth, yield, and productivity (Wang et al., 2016). Temperatures beyond the “physiological capacity” of plants have debilitating effects on biochemical processes, cellular homeostasis (Kotak et al., 2007), changes in enzyme activities, photosynthesis (Greer, 2015), protein synthesis (Ferguson et al., 1994), and membrane fluidity (Hemantaranjan et al., 2014).",
      "methods": "Hydrated fronds P. polypodioides were collected from live oak (Quercus virginiana) trees on the campus of the University of Louisiana at Lafayette (30.21 N, −92.02 W). All fronds were collected after a rain event during March to May from 2016 to 2019 and prior to experimentation maintained in a humid chamber at high RH.",
      "results": "Pinnae of dried Pleopeltis fronds curled tighter with increasing temperature treatment (Figures 2A–C). Dried tissue showed no effects, but discolorations became visible after rehydration.",
      "discussion": "Our data describe diverse responses to separate desiccation and high temperature stresses. As stated under section “Materials and Methods,” it is important to reiterate the arbitrary nature of the study."
