    "abstract": "Plants are primary producers of food and oxygen on Earth and will likewise be indispensable to the establishment of large-scale sustainable ecosystems and human survival in space. To contribute to the understanding of how plants respond to spaceflight stress, we examined the significance of the unfolded protein response (UPR), a conserved signaling cascade that responds to a number of unfavorable environmental stresses, in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Extraterrestrial habitation and prolonged space travel require successful plant growth to recreate livable environments for humans (Ferl et al., 2002; Massa et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2019). Studies over the past 70 years have sought to develop a better understanding of how plants are affected by and adapt to the significant stresses imposed by spaceflight (e.g., microgravity, radiation, vibration, limited exchange of gases), which can affect plant development and yield (Paul et al., 2013).",
      "methods": "This flight experiment utilized 4 Biological Research In a Canister (BRIC) containing a total of 22 Petri Dish Fixation Unit (PDFU) hardware (Wells et al., 2001) to cultivate sterile dark-grown seedlings germinated aboard the ISS for a 14 day period.",
      "results": "When we inspected the WT and UPR-mutant seedlings (atire1, bzip60, bzip28, and bzip28 bzip60) of the ground control and flight samples at the completion of the mission, we found that in the ground control samples, etiolated hypocotyls (i.e., pale and elongated due to the lack of light) were above the surface of the solidified media while roots had penetrated the growth medium perpendicular to the surface (Fig. 1A).",
      "discussion": "In this study, we examined the transcriptional responses of WT and seedlings with a compromised UPR to spaceflight to set the foundations to manipulate a critical growth and stress signaling pathway for improving plant adaptation to extraterrestrial environments."
