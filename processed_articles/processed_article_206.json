    "abstract": "Baker’s yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) has broad genetic homology to human cells. Although typically grown as 1-2mm diameter colonies under certain conditions yeast can form very large (10 + mm in diameter) or ‘giant’ colonies on agar. Giant yeast colonies have been used to study diverse biomedical processes such as cell survival, aging, and the response to cancer pharmacogenomics.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has broad genomic homology to human cells and is simple to grow and genetically manipulate (Lee et al. 2014; Kachroo et al. 2015; Nislow et al. 2015). This has made it a powerful model organism with biomedical applications to understand mechanisms of cell-to-cell interactions, cell survival, and aging (Cap et al. 2009a; Ayer et al. 2014; Herker et al. 2004).",
      "methods": "Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain BY4743 (i.e., wild type (WT)), was used to match our earlier studies (Hammond et al. 2015). This parental strain, as well as Msn4 deletion, Sfp1 deletion, BEM1-eGFP and TRR1-eGFP yeast clones were purchased from Life Technologies (Grand Island, NY).",
      "results": "Expression of the stress response genes, SSA4 and RPL34b, was measured using eGFP fusion protein expression clones. Stress promoter dependence was assessed by comparing the eGFP signal of the parent strains to clones in which the Msn4 or Sfp1 promoter genes had been deleted (Fig. 2 and Table 2).",
      "discussion": "Systematic studies of the effects of true microgravity and common microgravity simulations on cell physiology has been lacking. Furthermore, how these environments combine with other fundamental variables such as growth media to influence the cellular response to stress is an outstanding question."
