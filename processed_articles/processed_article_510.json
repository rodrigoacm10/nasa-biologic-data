      "introduction": "The International Space Station (ISS) is a man-made closed habitat that functions as a platform to study the impact of the distinct space environment, which includes enhanced irradiation and microgravity on humans1–7, animals8,9, plants10–14 and microorganisms15–19.",
      "methods": "Procedures to isolate and identify A. fumigatus collected from the ISS were described previously45.",
      "results": "Proteins with altered abundance in ISS-isolated strains ISSFT-021 and IF1SW-F4, and clinical isolates Af293 and CEA10, were investigated upon extraction of total protein from each strain.",
      "discussion": "The proteome of A. fumigatus has been studied under various conditions, including short-67, and long-term hypoxia68, following exposure to antifungal agents like amphotericin B69, and voriconazole70, and during different developmental stages58."
