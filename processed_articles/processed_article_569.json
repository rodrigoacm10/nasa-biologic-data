      "introduction": "The rotating-wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor is a suspension culture system that provides the necessary oxygen and nutrients for cells to develop and polarize while they grow under low fluid-shear conditions.",
      "methods": "Blood was obtained from volunteers in accordance with accepted ethical and humane practices.",
      "results": "Hammond et al. [51] summarized the principles for determining the optimal conditions for suspension cultures.",
      "discussion": "It has been reported that activated human T cells cultured in RWVs present alterations in expression of genes involved in several cellular processes such as signal transduction, DNA repair, apoptosis, immune and inflammatory responses, and metabolic pathways."
