    "abstract": "Stationary-phase bacteria are important in disease. The σs-regulated general stress response helps them become resistant to disinfectants, but the role of σs in bacterial antibiotic resistance has not been elucidated.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Stationary-phase bacteria play critical roles in disease causation (1–4). Due to a dearth of nutrients and/or other factors, bacteria in the host often experience this late growth phase (5–8), and it is in this phase that many of their virulence traits are primarily expressed (9–11).",
      "methods": "Bacteria were grown overnight to late stationary phase at 37°C in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth with shaking (200 rpm); the following morning, they were diluted to an A600 of 0.45 (1.3 × 109 cells/ml) in M9 minimal medium without glucose (34, 35) (referred to as M9 salts).",
      "results": "Deletion of the rpoS gene (absence of σs) rendered E. coli (K-12 BW25113) (33) more sensitive to Gm: at 24 h of treatment, mutant survival was more than 2 logs less than that of the wild type (Fig. 1).",
      "discussion": "The rpoS mutant of the two E. coli strains examined here exhibited greater Gm sensitivity than the wild type (Fig. 1)."

Loss of σs rendered stationary-phase E. coli more sensitive to the bactericidal antibiotic gentamicin (Gm), and proteomic analysis suggested involvement of a weakened antioxidant defense.",
