      "introduction": "Aging is a significant risk factor for a broad range of diseases including neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes and cancer1–5. With the growing aging population, the socioeconomic burden attributed with age-associated diseases is staggering and development of therapies that promote healthy aging is imperative.",
      "methods": "All animals were cultured on 60 mm petri dishes containing nematode growth medium (NGM) at 20 °C before loading into the microfluidic chamber.",
      "results": "We demonstrated that C. elegans can be effectively maintained in our NemaLife microfluidic device across its lifespan without using chemicals (progeny-blocking drugs, antibacterial agents, antifungal compounds, etc.) in an environment that recapitulates longevity on agar plates.",
      "discussion": "The capacity for manual injections of fluids and food enables investigator control over feeding conditions or introduced drugs."
