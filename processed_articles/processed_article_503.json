    "abstract": "Spaceflight poses a unique set of challenges to humans and the hostile spaceflight environment can induce a wide range of increased health risks, including dermatological issues. The biology driving the frequency of skin issues in astronauts is currently not well understood.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Throughout the course of a spaceflight mission, the astronaut exposome includes altered gravity, elevated radiation, and confinement within a closed environment with unique hygiene procedures, light cycles, and ventilation1. These stressors perturb biological systems, inducing gene regulatory changes, mitochondrial dysregulation, microbiome shifts, and DNA damage1. Dermatological issues are not typically regarded as a key risk to astronaut health and mission success, yet they are amongst the most common in-flight health issues reported by astronauts.",
      "methods": "This manuscript has included authors from all backgrounds from the scientific international community and the results are held at the highest ethical standards.",
      "results": "To explore whether transcriptomic changes in the skin would occur during spaceflight, we analyzed five RNA-Seq datasets from the NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR)40, all representing skin tissue from space flown mice and matching ground control replicates.",
      "discussion": "Skin is well-established as an essential organ for health on Earth, yet despite the frequency of dermatological issues in astronauts2, the molecular response of skin to spaceflight is understudied."
