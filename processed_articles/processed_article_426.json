      "introduction": "Fungal pathogens cause devastating losses of crops and postharvest fruits worldwide (Chen et al., 2008). Many chemical fungicides have been used in high doses and frequent intervals to prevent these losses by killing different fungal species. The global market for fungicides was estimated to be over $7.4 billion in 2005 (Morton and Staub, 2008) and is expected to rise to over $20 billion by 2017 (Israel, 2013). To reduce the risk of crop disease and enhance the safety of food, new effective fungicides or strategies to increase the potency of current fungicides need to be developed.",

    "insights_summary": "Apyrase inhibitors enhance the potency of different fungicides when compared with fungicide treatment alone. The apyrase inhibitors tested here did not affect the growth of fungi by themselves, but when combined with fungicides, they increased the sensitivity of fungi to the fungicide treatments in 53 of the 60 treatment combinations tested.",
