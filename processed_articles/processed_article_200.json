    "abstract": "The wasps Leptopilina heterotoma parasitize and ingest their Drosophila hosts. They produce extracellular vesicles (EVs) in the venom that are packed with proteins, some of which perform immune suppressive functions. EV interactions with blood cells of host larvae are linked to hematopoietic depletion, immune suppression, and parasite success.",

      "introduction": "Parasitoid (parasitic) wasps have an obligatory relationship with their insect hosts. Engaged in a biological “arms race,” each partner continuously adapts to the other to emerge alive. For reproductive success, parasitic wasps target their hosts’ behavior, development and immune system.",
      "methods": "All D. melanogaster stocks were raised on standard fly medium containing cornmeal flour, sucrose, yeast, and agar at 25°C.",
      "results": "Lb17 attack triggers lamellocyte differentiation in the larval lymph gland cortex (Fig 1A–1C). At an equivalent time-point, Lh-infected lobes are significantly smaller (Fig 1D–1K); [13].",
      "discussion": "Parasitism by L. heterotoma has been of interest because of its ability to parasitize many Drosophila hosts and the existence of venom factors that kill host hemocytes."
