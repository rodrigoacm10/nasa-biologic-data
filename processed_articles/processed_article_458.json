    "abstract": "Many viruses attach to host cells by first interacting with cell surface proteoglycans containing heparan sulfate (HS) glycosaminoglycan chains and then by engaging with specific receptor, resulting in virus entry. In this project, HSâ€“virus interactions were targeted by a new fucosylated chondroitin sulfate from the sea cucumber Pentacta pygmaea (PpFucCS) in order to block human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) entry into cells.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Betaherpesviruses, including human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), are common human pathogens, yet only a small percentage of infected people experience acute illness [1]. In people with impaired immune systems, HCMV-mediated infections can be life-threatening.",
      "methods": "PpFucCS extraction and purification: As previously reported [30], PpFucCS was recovered from the body wall of the sea cucumber P. pygmaea (Gulf Specimen Lab Gulf of Mexico, Florida Keys) by performing proteolytic digestion using papain (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA).",
      "results": "The native PpFucCS exhibited potent and efficacious inhibitory activity against HCMV while the PpFucCS fractions showed decreased activity in both potency and efficacy (Figure 2A).",
      "discussion": "In this study, we demonstrated that PpFucCS and its hydrolyzed fractions efficiently inhibit the HCMV infection of primary human fibroblasts, specifically blocking virus entry into the cells."
