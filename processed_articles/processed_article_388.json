    "abstract": "Using a ground-based model to simulate spaceflight [21-days of single-housed, hindlimb unloading (HLU) combined with continuous low-dose gamma irradiation (LDR, total dose of 0.04 Gy)], an in-depth survey of the immune and hematological systems of mice at 7-days post-exposure was performed.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "While the majority of spaceflight studies focus on the physiological responses during or immediately after flight, readaptation to nominal gravitational environments is also an important factor in astronaut health.",
      "methods": "Six-month-old, female C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Laboratory) were acclimatized in standard habitats at 20 Â°C with a 12 h:12 h light:dark cycle for 7 days.",
      "results": "Principal component analysis (PCA) plots were generated with each cohort (Fig. 1A). Venn diagrams revealed no overlap of downregulated (Fig. 1B) nor upregulated (Fig. 1C) DEG.",
      "discussion": "Recovery post-spaceflight is systemically taxing and often leaves a lasting impression on human health."
