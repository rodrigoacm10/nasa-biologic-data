    "abstract": "The absence of leptin results in contrasting growth pattern of appendicular and axial bone growth in ob/ob mice. Endochondral bone formation is an important procedure of growth plate determining the bone growth, where this procedure is also regulated by estrogen and its receptor (ER) signaling pathway.",
    "sections": {
      "introduction": "Leptin, a protein encoded by obese gene (ob), has been shown to have regulative effects on longitudinal bone growth, spongiosa maturation, and bone turnover between cortical and cancellous bones (1).",
      "methods": "Three-week-old female B6/JGpt-Lepem1Cd25/Gpt mice on the C57BL/6 background (ob/ob mice, n = 6/group) and 3-week-old female C57BL/6 (n = 6/group) mice were purchased from Nanjing GemPharmatech Co., Ltd.",
      "results": "At the end of mice’s puberty, X-ray was performed to collect images of the femur and lumbar spine.",
      "discussion": "Although the contrasting phenotypes in bone of the limb and spine were observed in leptin deficiency mice, the reason and mechanisms remain unclear and need to be explored."
