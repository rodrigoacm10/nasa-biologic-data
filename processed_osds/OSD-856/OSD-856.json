    "description": "The following general conclusions can be made concerning the use of tissue culture for assaying the effects of mineral elements from simulated lunar soil or other mineral samples: The method used here is a very sensitive one for showing that soluble materials are reaching the tissue explant. The effects found (inhibiting) are very probably caused by excess toxic materials or competition of non-essential elements with essential elements rather than pH changes because previously pH has been found- to have relatively little effect over a wide range.",
