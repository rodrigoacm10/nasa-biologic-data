    "description": "\"The environmental samples were collected with the polyester wipes from eight different locations in the International Space Station (ISS) during two consecutive sampling sessions (three months apart) within the ISS Microbial Observatory Experiment. DNA extracted from each of the samples was used to create amplicon libraries based on customized panel of 500 antimicrobial resistance genes followed by next-generation sequencing.",
