    "description": "To combat DNA damage, organisms mount a DNA damage response (DDR) that results in cell cycle regulation, DNA repair and, in severe cases, cell death. Underscoring the importance of gene regulation in this response, studies in Arabidopsis have demonstrated that all of the aforementioned processes rely on SUPPRESSOR OF GAMMA RESPONSE 1 (SOG1), a NAC family transcription factor (TF) that has been functionally equated to the mammalian tumor suppressor, p53.",
