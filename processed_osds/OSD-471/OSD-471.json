We would like to acknowledge the Russian Federal Space Agency for flying the Bion M1 mission, as well as the staff of the M.V. Lomonosov Moscow State University Institute of Mitoengineering for providing animal facilities. mCT imaging was performed at the Bone Imaging Research Core of the Endocrine Research Unit at the UCSF-affiliated Veterans Affairs Medical Center. We would also like to thank Aaron Fields and Jeannie Bailey for contributing helpful advice for this study. None of the authors have affiliations that are perceived to have biased the presentation.",
